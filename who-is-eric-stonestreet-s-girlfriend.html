Flash forward a few weeks and the duo was coupled up, and happily so! While they definitely prefer to keep their relationship as private as possible, we've managed to do a little digging and get the inside scoop on just who Lindsay Schweitzer is. Let's get into it!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern Family: 15 Controversies Fans May Not Know About</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-lindsay-schweitzer>Who Is Lindsay Schweitzer?</h2><p>Lindsay Schweitzer is the long-time girlfriend to "Modern Family" actor, Eric Stonestreet. While we love ourselves some Cam and Mitch, we are loving this even more! Stonestreet and Schweitzer met back in 2017 at a celebrity fundraiser event called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Slick in Kansas City.</a> The weekend saw a number of familiar faces including Stonestreet's, Paul Rudd and Rob Riggle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two instantly hit it off and began dating a few weeks later! While Lindsay me be dating an actor from one of the most successful shows in ABC history, she has remained out of the spotlight. Schweitzer has attended only a few major red carpet events alongside Eric Stonestreet, but for the most part, she chooses to avoid the limelight as much as she can. This most likely stems from not being a part of the entertainment industry!&nbsp;Schweitzer is a pediatric nurse, and while we aren't sure which city she works out of, we can only assume it is Los Angeles, as this is where Stonestreet resides.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cast Of Modern Family: Then & Now</a></span></p><h2 id=a-match-made-in-heaven>A Match Made In Heaven</h2><p>Eric Stonestreet has not has very much luck when it comes to his personal life and dating. The actor was romantically linked to Skinny Girl owner, Bethenny Frankel prior to dating Schweitzer, however, their relationship fizzled and it appears as if the two were "better off as friends", despite Eric claiming she was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"wonderful kisser"</a>. Although that relationship may not have worked out, he has since struck gold!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to the connection Eric and Lindsay share, it goes without saying that she&nbsp;is certainly a great match for him and vice versa. Stonestreet has mentioned just how "lucky" he is to have met someone as great as Schweitzer and we definitely do not blame him! It didn't take much time for Eric and Lindsay to fall head over heels for one another, in fact, one friend said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"they are very happy</a> to have met each other and are enjoying spending time together" a source tells PEOPLE&nbsp;Magazine.&nbsp;Despite their strong intent on keeping their private life very private, we are ecstatic to see the two very much happy and in love!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Modern Family's, Nolan Gould?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikqJyVp7tussCmoKWxo2KwormMsJ%2BoZZmoeqa%2ByJxkrKyfo7K0wNGenK2rXZy2s7jFq6CeppRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
