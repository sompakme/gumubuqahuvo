Now that the <a class=hoverZoomLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fruit had matured Cardi B was more than eager to take a bite out of the huge fruit</a>. The 27-year-old announced that she was going to attempt to crack open her Jackfruit by dropping it onto the ground.</p><p>The rapper originally stood a top of an outdoor futon in an all-white ensemble, noting that “she needed to change to avoid ruining her outfit.” The camera suddenly switches to Cardi B in a short red hoodie and the short shorts to match. The WAP rapper then proceeds to drop the Jackfruit and watches as it hits the ground. Unfortunately, the huge fruit doesn’t crack on the first try as the rapper clearly anticipated. The second time doesn’t go quite as planned either, which leads Cardi B to finally give up and resort to cutting the fruit open herself. When the 27-year-old finally makes progress, she does a hilarious barefoot victory dance. The rapper really knows to make a hilarious Instagram video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardi B Sizzles In Femme Fatale Shoot - Is She Giving Us A Clue About Her Upcoming Film Role?</a></span></p><h2 id=maybe-it-s-the-big-hair-or-jackfruit>Maybe It’s The Big Hair Or Jackfruit</h2><p>According to the internet, Cardi B stands a good 5’3” which is two inches below mid height. We’d never be able to tell her actual height, since we’re used to seeing the rapper wear heels. However, fans were quick to take notice of Cardi B’s small height after watching her new hilarious Instagram video.</p><p>One fan bluntly wrote, “You so short” with a crying laughing emoji face tagged to the comment. Others soon responded to the fans comment, with one fan giving the cheeky response, “TV screen is deceiving, hun?” Either that, or it’s the fact that she’s cutting open a huge melon-sized fruit. Not to mention, her huge high ponytail and bare feet made her appear smaller in person. No matter what size Cardi B is, fans find her all the more hilarious and adorable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Tall Is Cardi B (& 9 Other Things You Didn't Know About Her)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYq6zsYyrnJqkma%2B2r7OMoaawZaOdvLPAjJyYq5yZYq9uvsSao6WxXZ7AbrXNZp%2Beql2nsqSxza1ko5mToLOzwcitZKKmo6mubrzOrKto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
