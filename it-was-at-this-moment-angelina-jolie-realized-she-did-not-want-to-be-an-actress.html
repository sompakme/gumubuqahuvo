And I started going to theater and going on auditions young. I only realized about five years ago that I actually didn’t want to be an actor. I’m a very private person. I don’t go out much. I’m home with kids. I go to work. I don’t really like being the focus of attention, which is why I like being behind the camera more,” Jolie revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bertrand, who died in 2007 at age 56 after a battle with ovarian cancer, gave up her dreams of being an actress herself to focus on motherhood.

"When my father had an affair, it changed her life. It set her dream of family life ablaze.
