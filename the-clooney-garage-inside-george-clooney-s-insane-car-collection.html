From films such as the Ocean trilogy, Up in the Air, Batman & Robin, and Gravity, he is one of the most recognizable actors in the industry. The actor, who has won the Academy Award not once but twice, <a href=#>has been in many successful movies</a>, including some in which he plays some of the most famous characters in history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to being regarded as one of the most significant actors working in Hollywood today, <a href=#>Clooney possesses exceptional taste when it comes to luxury items</a>. He has been an avid collector of both classic and high-performance automobiles. He has vintage cars such as a vintage Corvette, a Porsche, and a flagship Lexus. So let’s take a peek inside George Clooney’s insane car collection.</p><h2 id=porsche-911-gt3-rs>Porsche 911 GT3 RS</h2><p>It shouldn't come as a surprise that George Clooney, who already possesses a classic Porsche, would purchase this high-performance model. This was a present from his wife to him on the occasion of his birthday. The Porsche 911 GT3 RS is among the brand's array of vehicles that exude the most zeal and excitement. The 4.0-liter flat-six engine found in the GT3 RS is responsible for the insane 520 horsepower output, which in turn leads to a driving experience that is unlike any other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1959-chevrolet-corvette-c1>1959 Chevrolet Corvette C1</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vintage Corvette that Clooney currently drives</a> was first purchased for the family by George Clooney's father. Since he has had such a deep-seated fondness for that automobile ever since he was a child, he has been taking it out for a ride. Since Clooney's father purchased the 1959 Chevrolet Corvette C1 out of his love for Clooney's mother, George Clooney considers this vehicle to be his most treasured possession. The car has a striking and elegant design that is stunning from any vantage point one chooses to observe it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Peek Inside Tom Hardy's Insane Car Collection</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lexus-ls>Lexus LS</h2><p>Additionally, he possesses a luxury Lexus LS in his collection. He decided to get it so that he could navigate the city without being recognized by the general public and could easily avoid being photographed by the paparazzi. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 2012 Lexus LS</a> has a luxurious interior with a 380 hp, 4.6-liter V6 engine that can go from 0 to 60 mph in 5.4 seconds.</p><h2 id=porsche-911-carrera-2-cabriolet>Porsche 911 Carrera 2 Cabriolet</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 1993 Porsche Carrera 2 Cabriolet is among the most famous vehicles in George's collection. A vehicle with a genuine focus on the driver, which takes in and lets out nothing but pure excitement. Elegant design paired with a refined 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine producing over 247 hp is exactly what you need. Due to the fact that there were only 930 of this model ever produced, the Porsche Carrera 2 is highly rare and quite pricey if one were to acquire one now.</p><h2 id=tesla-roadster-signature-100>Tesla Roadster Signature 100</h2><p>George was one of the first people to get his hands on a Tesla Roadster and go behind the wheel of the original model. The fact that he is a die-hard fan of <a href=#>classic cars</a> reveals how strongly he feels about electric vehicles (EVs). This Roadster was one of the Signature 100 variants with over 200 miles of range and 248 hp from its electric motors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside George Clooney’s Multi-Million-Dollar Real Estate Portfolio</a></span></p><h2 id=tango-t600-ev>Tango T600 EV</h2><p>Having a taste for EVs, he was one of the first to purchase the new Tango T600 EV. A vehicle with a footprint so compact that it could fit with these on a single lane. The T600 was designed to address the city's traffic congestion issues. With a 0-60 mph acceleration time of less than 4 seconds and a top speed of 150 mph, it is remarkable that the T600 was such a compact vehicle. As one of the first to purchase this production EV, Clooney paid a whopping $123,000 for this vehicle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ford-f-150-raptor>Ford F-150 Raptor</h2><p>George Clooney's <a href=#>amazing car collection</a> is modest in comparison to that of other celebrities. He has a pickup truck and a greater number of luxury vehicles than the average driver. In his garage, there are no expensive or rare Ferraris, but there is a $70,000 Ford F-150 Raptor that is unique. Clooney's favorite car is the first-generation Ford Raptor, despite not owning any European automobiles.&nbsp;The F-150 Raptor is prepared to tackle all terrains with unmatched off-road durability and trail-conquering prowess. It is a purpose-built off-road vehicle meant to travel where there are no roads and plenty of cracked desert ground to explore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mercedes-g63-amg>Mercedes G63 AMG</h2><p>In 2012, George Clooney gifted himself this automobile. This Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG, which is equipped with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 577 hp and 627 pound-feet of torque and 9-speed automatic transmission, is another <a href=#>insane car</a> in the George Clooney car collection. The G63's highest speed is 149 mph, and it can go from 0 to 60 mph in less than 3.9 seconds. The G-Wagon is a wonderful off-road vehicle with greater comfort than the original G-wagon due to its tuned suspension.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>A Peek Inside John Cena’s Florida Mansion</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Auto Bizz</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">21 Motoring</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGabnKS8r7HYZp6aqpGcsm61zaygnZ1dnLKwvsaeZJykn6S7psXSZqCnq5Gjsm6vwKtknKecobKkwMiopWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
