After serving eight months, he was released in September 2019 — and the night he got home, they conceived. That November, Lauren revealed they had <a href=#>suffered a “heart-wrenching” miscarriage</a>.</p><p>“When I found out we were pregnant, I felt like this is why we went through all these challenges for years and that this was our time and it was our blessing. … It was hard. It was really difficult,” she said during an ABC interview. “I didn’t want to hold this in. I wanted to share it for other people going through it and just be honest so I can kind of heal through the process.”</p><p>Later that month, she told Entertainment Tonight that they were “doing OK” after the heartbreak.</p><p>“[Mike] leads our family by example, with going through our past tragedies and trying to <a href=#>pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off</a>,” she said at the time. “I looked at him lost when this happened, like, ‘I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to recover from this.’ And he just kept doing the next right thing. You get ready for the day. You’re just one day at a time, and we’re almost a month later, and I’m doing a lot better.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One month later, the Dancing With the Stars alum shared exclusively with Us Weekly that the high school <a href=#>sweethearts were “definitely trying” to conceive</a> again.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below for their sweet gender reveal pics.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkuqq3xGaroZ1dqLa1wcCtoKimXai8s77Ep6uipp9ixKqyxGajmq2imrtuvsSvnJqkXZeuo8XSZqqesF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
