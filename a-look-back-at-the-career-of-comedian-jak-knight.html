He was born in Seattle, Washington, and reared there. He had a fascinating sense of humor that he employed in his comedy, and he always wanted to be a comic. Knight first became interested in stand-up comedy during his senior year of high school. So, after receiving his degree, he relocated to Los Angeles to begin his comedic career. Knight was only beginning his career as a comedian when Knight first began sharing his comedy videos online. In an interview, he revealed that <a href=#>comedic genius Dave Chappelle </a>had been his inspiration. After becoming well-known, Knight performed multiple stand-up comedy acts on stage. Later, he started creating comedy series and participated in other significant initiatives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Knight said in a 2018 interview that the comedian worked as a writer on the animated Lucas Bros. When Knight was 20 years old, he joined Moving Co. Keith and Kenneth Lucas, the co-creators and identical twin brothers. Knight didn't know exactly how the brothers heard about him. He mentioned that it was as easy as the brothers called him to join him for a smoke, and then that was it. On a season of Black-ish, Knight served as an executive story editor in addition to writing for Moving Company and Lucas Bros. After that show, the comedian contributed to Bill Burr's comedy series Immoral Compass. He also managed to work on Netflix's popular animated series Big Mouth, where he served as a staff writer and story editor. DeVon's voice was also provided by him.

The majority of them are cameo roles. In terms of criticism, stand-up comedy may be harsh. Everybody has a viewpoint. A person might not find anything funny that the comic finds amusing. The finest performers are those who make it seem simple, just like with anything else. They appeal to many people. Even without the need to make people laugh, it is common knowledge that many people fear public speaking more than they fear dying.</p><h2 id=reaching-his-peak-before-his-sudden-demise>Reaching His Peak Before His Sudden Demise</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before his passing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Knight had already found success</a> in many projects, including The Morning Show, Kevin Hart's Winter Olympics Tailgate Party, The Stand-Up Show with Jon Dore, Straight Up, and Stand Up.
