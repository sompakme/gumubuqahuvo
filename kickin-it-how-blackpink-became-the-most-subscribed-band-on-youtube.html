So what made them so famous? "The way they perform, their iconic songs and choreos, their friendship, even the way they dress. Blackpink were on a whole new level," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said Blink to Vogue UK, one of the groups' fans.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">K-Pop Superstars 'BTS' Secret To Making Millions Of Dollars, Explained</a></span></p><h2 id=what-s-so-special-about-the-band>What's So Special About The Band</h2><p>Several versions explain their popularity.
