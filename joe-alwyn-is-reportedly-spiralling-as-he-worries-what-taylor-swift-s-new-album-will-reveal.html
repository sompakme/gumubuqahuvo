Apparently, Joe Alwyn is growing increasingly worried about what her album could reveal and how the public’s response could hurt him and his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s safe to say that Joe is bracing himself for a lot of questions. No one is safe,” a source who’s allegedly close to Taylor disclosed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life & Style</a> . “Joe should be worried about what she reveals.”</p><p>Taylor revealed new music is on its way during the 2024 Grammys ceremony on Sunday, February 4 while accepting the Best Pop Vocal Album, marking her 13th Grammy triumph.</p><p>"The way I can celebrate is by telling you a secret that I’ve been keeping from you for the past two years, which is that my brand new album comes out April 19th," she told the crowd during her acceptance speech. "It’s called The Tortured Poets Department and I’m going to go post the cover right now backstage."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fulfilling her promise, Taylor promptly turned to Instagram, where she shared the album's cover art, featuring her reclining on a bed adorned in black lingerie. Alongside the visual, Swift unveiled what appeared to be handwritten verses, possibly hinting at new lyrics that’ll be featured on the highly anticipated record.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:05</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/travis-kelce-s-overspending-almost-depleted-his-net-worth-front-deposite-back-ig.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Travis Kelce's Crazy Overspending Almost Depleted His Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite making millions, NFL superstar Travis Kelce almost went broke due to his extreme overspending.</span><p>"And so I enter into evidence my tarnished coat of arms.

Following Swift’s announcement, social media sleuths unearthed an interview from December 2022, where Joe did an interview with Paul Mescal for Variety's Actors on Actors segment, where he revealed they have a group chat they dubbed "The Tortured Man Club,” a name eerily similar to Taylor’s new album’s title.</p><p>“It hasn’t had much use recently,” the Conversations With Friends star admitted in the interview. Paul, 28, agreed as he chimed in, “No. I feel like we’re less tortured now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor and Joe reportedly began dating in late 2016, shortly after her highly publicized breakup with Tom Hiddleston. Alwyn is known for his roles in movies such as "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk" (2016), "The Favourite" (2018), and "Mary Queen of Scots" (2018). The pair’s break-up was announced early last year. Swift had a brief romance with The 1975 frontman Matty Healy before debuting her relationship with Travis Kelce in September, though she’s since revealed they began dating earlier in the summer before taking their romance public.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ1dlrm4xc1mqZ6on6fBprDLsmSsqJmnrq24yKeeZq%2Bfp7%2BqsdJmrqGZpGLBosXLqKlmq6ees7W%2FjJqjm62dYr%2BmwsSao2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
