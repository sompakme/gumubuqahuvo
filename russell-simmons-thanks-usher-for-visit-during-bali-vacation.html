Simmons is accused of violent sexual behavior or misconduct by more than a dozen women, with several sharing their traumatic stories in the 2020 <a href=#>On The Record</a> documentary.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Drew Dixon, a former Def Jam A&R executive who was featured in the film, is <a href=#>currently suing</a> Simmons for defamation for calling her a “liar” after she leveled claims of sexual assault. According to court documents, Simmons “has gone on a concerted and malicious campaign to discredit Ms. Dixon and to so damage her reputation” and “this defamation has exacerbated the paralyzation of Ms. Dixon professionally.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Additionally, Simmons is <a href=#>being sued by another</a> woman, a former music producer, who alleges she was raped by the famous music executive under the New York’s Adult Survivors Act and the New York City Gender Motivated Violence Act. In her suit, Jane Doe alleges Simmons made a “wrestling move,” pinned her down on his bed, and proceeded to rape her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1743795493.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In a December 2023 clip from&nbsp;In Depth with Graham Bensinger,&nbsp;Simmons claimed to had taken lie detector tests for each “serious” allegation.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I took nine lie detector tests, people don’t know that,” said Simmons. “Nine separate — seven from the Chairman of the Polygraph Association. One for each and serious accusation.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, “When someone said, for instance, ‘I was violent’ — one person said that — and I’ve never been violent. Took that. And one said I apologized. I never apologized about assaulting anyone. But if two people say it, because one said it, and #metoo, and the second person said it, then I took a test for it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Check out the discussion below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6fCtL%2FEpaNmq5miurC60masrKCVp3q3tdKiq2aakaG2bsLAnJitoZ%2BjenJ%2Bkm1vbm9jZ4Rw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
