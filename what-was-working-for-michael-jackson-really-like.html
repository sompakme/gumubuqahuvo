While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">controversy plagued his name</a> in later years (and likely always will, with people on both sides of the myth even now), there’s no denying that he was one of the most influential pop artists in the world. Some musicians attest that his work is still incredibly influential, and he has a variety of musical artists influenced by his work now. But who was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the person behind the music</a>? While we have an idea of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who he was on a personal level</a>, one area of life is still a little blank. What he was like to work with is a tricky nail to hammer down. He worked intensely for so much of his life, making it no surprise that what he was like to work with changed throughout the years. We found some highlights, though, and proof that Michael Jackson was maybe just as amazing behind the scenes as he was on stage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth Behind All Of Michael Jackson's Plastic Surgeries</a></span></p><h2 id=spike-lee-loved-him>Spike Lee Loved Him</h2><p>This one might have been tinged by a bit of nostalgia, but either way, it’s worth including. Spike Lee was always a huge fan of Michael Jackson, having grown up on his music. Lee is also the kind of director who won’t take any flack from anyone. Not to mention how he tends to be as strong a creative personality as Michael Jackson was. However, that might have made them kindred creative spirits. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lee describes working with Michael Jackson</a> on the set of one of Jackson’s music videos. “[Jackson] wasn't a person to sit back and let somebody else determine, you know. He liked input, but he would have the final say and he had a great instinct and he knew what was best for him. He knew what worked for him,” and Spike Lee respected that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, Spike Lee more than respected Michael Jackson. Reading the article makes us believe that he almost revered him. Or, at least revered his work ethic. Working for Michael Jackson is summarized by Spike Lee’s adoration for Jackson’s work ethic: “I've been around a lot of great athletes, Michael Jordan. Recently there is a documentary on Kobe Bryant. And these guys are known for their work ethic. And as great as Michael was, and as great as Kobe is, [Michael Jackson] could give those guys a run for their money when it comes to work ethic.” It’s always easy to work with someone who’s driven and passionate about working for themselves. No doubt this added to Spike Lee’s enjoyment of working with Michael Jackson.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jackson Used To Own A Chimp...

His bodyguards, the people who worked the most intimately with Jackson, also had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">good words about their experience</a> too. Near the end of Michael Jackson’s life, there was quite a bit of debt following him around. The bodyguards Jackson was assigned knew that better than anyone (except for Michael Jackson’s accountant). "We stayed with him out of loyalty… But there were times we were in hotels and credit cards were being maxed out and management were about to ask us to leave. This was Michael Jackson and I was thinking 'How is this happening?'" That’s not a harsh judgment, though; the bodyguards were very kind to Michael Jackson.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Women Michael Jackson Dated (And 10 He Had No Chance With)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michael Jackson was kind to them in turn, too. While stars the caliber of Jackson can end up treating bodyguards as expendable, annoying, or less-than-human, Jackson and his bodyguards were all operating with a mutual level of respect. And that level was very respectful. The guards never spoke about any mistreatment at the hands of Michael Jackson and “we had a motto that nothing would happen on our watch. He was a good boss. He was really thoughtful and would ask about my family,” a rare level of personal interest in this kind of relationship.</p><p>And these are only two examples of many, which firmly makes us believe that it was always a good time working for Michael Jackson. Sure, he worked hard and was very specific about what he wanted; but that’s not a bad thing. Producers, publicists, and directors who say that he was tough to work with should have known what they were signing up for. Greatness comes at a cost, but that cost wasn’t kindness, in Michael Jackson’s case. He was always concerned with his employees’ well being, which made for a good working environment. Even Spike Lee was impressed with what it was like to work for him, though their connection was more of a collaboration. All in all, we believe that Michael Jackson can rest easy knowing that the lives he touched were pleased with their time spent with him. Generally, he was a great person to work for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Jackson Does What She Wants, Even If That Includes Giving Herself A Foot Tattoo!</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSiv4ywpqujmaO0brLOq2SmoZOdrqa4jKOYnKOjpLtuvsSao6WxXaG2rLGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
