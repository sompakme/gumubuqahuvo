Hulk Hogan said, “When I saw the wreck, I didn’t think anybody was alive,” he added, “I thought no one could have lived through a wreck like that.”</p><p>He said that he was going to meet the boys at a local restaurant. “We were going to get something to eat and Nick paged me and said, ‘Dad, I want to go early, because we donât have a table at the restaurant.’ … As I was going down our normal route to the restaurant, I saw this yellow car and it happened to be twisted … and there were ambulances there and police were there, and — BAM — it was my car.”</p><p>Hogan said that Nick is doing fine, “He’s got a broken arm, some broken ribs, some neck problems and some stuff wrong with his knees but he’s hanging in there. He’s living at the hospital with John. He’s going to be okay and John’s going to be okay and we’re going to move forward.”</p><p>He also spoke about the passenger, John Graziano, saying “We were always close. The crazy thing is that John is like my son too. When he went to Kuwait and came back, it was like a miracle. So the bond with these boys and with these two families is something that people don’t understand. It’s a tough one for all of us.”</p><p>Hulk Hogan also denied that that Nick was racing at the time of the crash.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfpBva25rXZ3CrbeMoaagmZ5iwLGxwKSqZqeeYruqr8pmmJybmZmyr8CMpqarnQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
