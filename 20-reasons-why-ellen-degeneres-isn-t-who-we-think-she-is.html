Her success in show business has made her very influential, and many believe she has used her influence for the greater good. She is the only woman in history to have hosted both the Emmy Awards and the Academy Awards, and her success doesn't stop there. She's written four novels to date, and&nbsp; she was one of the very first homosexual celebrities to publicly come out. In fact, she came out despite the backlash she would inevitably receive from viewers and sponsors. However, this didn't slow her down in the slightest.</p><p>She has received thirty-three daytime television Emmy Awards, twenty Peoples' Choice Awards, the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, and the Medal of Freedom from President Obama himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 60-year-old has&nbsp;changed the world in many ways, and we're excited to see what she does next. She makes an average of $220,000 a day. Yes, you read that right. She is one of the most celebrated ladies around. But underneath her chipper demeanor and great sense of humor is a woman who has been through a tremendous amount of hardship.&nbsp;She has overcome more than most people can even imagine. Let's take a look at 20 things about Ellen that prove we don't really know her at all.</p><h2 id=she-grew-up-as-a-christian-scientist><strong>She Grew Up As A Christian Scientist</strong></h2><p>Ellen was raised in a very strict religious environment. Her parents were devout Christian scientists, a form of Christianity that claims illness can be cured by prayer alone. Christian scientists believe that one should rely on faith to cure all of their ailments, and that modern medicine is unnecessary. The founder of the religion, Mary Baker Eddy, established it as "a return to primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing." Ellen has spoken extensively about her childhood, and she has a less than favorable opinion of the religious movement.&nbsp; She did not receive any medical treatment until she was thirteen years old, not even over-the-counter medications.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I was raised very, very strictly with Christian Science. I didn’t have a shot or an aspirin or anything until I was 13 years old. We had to go to church, do testimonies every Wednesday night.”</strong></p><p>However, Ellen is still a spiritual person. She has a very open and accepting view of a higher power, and that is something that carries over to her everyday life. "I think all religion is based on what happens after this life. You live a certain way so that when you die, things can be good. But why can’t things be good now? Why can’t you understand that you’re in heaven now? That’s how I live. I believe in God. I think that God is everywhere. Every morning I look outside, and I say, 'Hi, God.' Because I think that the trees are God. I think that our whole experience is God.”</p><h2 id=she-wasn-t-the-funny-one-in-her-family><strong>She Wasn't The Funny One In Her Family</strong></h2><p>Yup, you read that right. I know, it's hard to believe, but Ellen actually wasn't the funny one in the family. Her brother, Vance Degeneres was! In fact, he's a comedian as well. When they were growing up, Ellen was more interested in riding her bike and exploring outdoors. It wasn't until after her parents divorce when she was thirteen years old, that her funny side began to shine through. When she moved to Texas to stay with her mother, her brother split off and stayed with their father. It was a tumultuous time in their lives, and Ellen found comfort in comedy. It was therapeutic for her. She used her sense of humor to cope with her parents divorce, and her sudden life changes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We all know Ellen's famous dance moves, right? Well, those dance moves originated around this time. She loved making her mother laugh by dancing like a lunatic around the house. Vance and Ellen are still close to this day, despite their split as young kids. Vance actually was in the Marine Corps before pursuing a career in the entertainment industry. They've both been successful, and they're both hilarious! He even co-runs Steve Carrell's production company, Carousel Productions.</p><h2 id=she-s-known-loss><strong>She's Known Loss</strong></h2><p>When Ellen was only twenty years old, her life was torn apart by the tragic loss of her girlfriend. Her relationship with her girlfriend was rocky during the events leading to her death, but Ellen was certain they would work things out. Ellen had moved out of their apartment and was staying with friends at the time.</p><p><strong>“I was planning on moving back in. I was just trying to teach her a lesson, and I was staying with some friends,”she stated in an an episode of Oprah's Master Class.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The night she lost her girlfriend, they went to a venue together to see Ellen's brother's band. Her girlfriend wanted her to move back in, but Ellen did not feel she was ready to take that next step. Her girlfriend decided to leave without Ellen. Not long after, Ellen actually drove past the fatal accident, totally unaware that it was her girlfriend. The loss took a toll on her, and though I would never wish her situation on anyone, it certainly makes Ellen feel a little more human, a little more real. She's known loss on a level that many people haven't, and she's grown stronger from it.</p><h2 id=picky-about-her-roles><strong>Picky About Her Roles</strong></h2><p>It seems Ellen has always been calculated when it comes to her next big career move.&nbsp;She turned down two major roles that we know about. Phoebe, from the hit sitcom, Friends, and the role of Annie Porter in Speed. Obviously, those roles went to Lisa Kudrow and Sandra Bullock, and regardless of their success, Ellen clearly made the right moves for herself by turning them down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Though Ellen was producer's first choice for the role of Phoebe, she ultimately turned down the role because she&nbsp;was in the midst of starring in her own sitcom, Ellen.</strong></p><p>We'll never know what might have become of her had she chosen to move forward with this role, but we can assume that things would be different for both Ellen, and the show. I mean, Ellen is wonderful and lovable, but you can't deny that the vibe Lisa Kudrow brings to the show is totally different than what Ellen would have brought. The role of Annie in Speed was first offered to Halle Barry, who declined. The producers then switched things up a bit by making Annie provide comic relief as Jack's sidekick, with Ellen in mind. When Ellen also declined, they then decided to make the character provide both comic relief, as well as a later love interest to Jack. From there, Sandra Bullock took over.</p><h2 id=gift-free-holidays><strong>Gift-Free Holidays</strong></h2><p>It may come as a shock, considering just how rich Ellen and her wife are, not to mention the fact that Ellen gives out amazing gifts to deserving people all the time on her show. But Ellen and her wife, Portia, do not exchange gifts on holidays! The sentiment behind it is actually quite sweet. Her and her wife do not exchange gifts on Christmas or birthdays because they have everything in the world they could want. They have each other, and that is all they could ever want. "Love and respect — that is all we need." Their love is truly sweet and pure. They believe the holidays are for spending quality time with loved ones, and they don't need gifts to convey their appreciation for one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"We just found the right person. It's corny, but she's my soulmate. She's my everything to me and I don't know what I'd do without her."</strong></p><p>Ellen has surprised her wife with gifts in the past, however. In 2013, she and her wife, Portia de Rossi, were walking through a parking lot when they came upon de Rossi's dream car. The beautiful Land Rover had a bid bow on the hood, and when de Rossi turned around Ellen was dangling the dangling the keys for her.</p><h2 id=she-was-sued-by-record-labels><strong>She Was Sued By Record Labels</strong></h2><p>The Ellen Degeneres Show was sued by various record labels over copyright issues. All those times that Ellen has danced on her show to different songs caught up to her and bit her in the butt. According to Billboard.biz, the labels allege that Ellen used over 1000 songs during her dance overs, all without ever paying for any of the licenses. Industry experts were interested by the timing. It perfectly coincided with her term as a judge on American Idol, which only lasted one season. The Rolling Stone had this to say:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"Ironically, one of the companies suing The Ellen DeGeneres Show is Sony Music Group, home to both RCA and Jive Records — where Idols usually land if they're successful on the show. Still, it seems that it was just coincidence that the lawsuit was filed the same day DeGeneres was named the new judge on American Idol, as the record companies and the Ellen show were reportedly working on resolving the issue."</strong></p><p>So, while it's unclear whether it was simply a coincidence or not, it's certainly interesting. We're not sure why Ellen didn't just pay for the songs in the first place, but when they were asked in court, the defendants said that they don't "roll that way." Funny, yes. Appropriate? Maybe not so much.</p><h2 id=she-s-loved-by-disney><strong>She's Loved By Disney</strong></h2><p>We all know Ellen is loved by Disney. I mean, she was practically the star in Finding Nemo, as the voice actor for the lovable, forgetful fish, Dory. And she was literally the star in the second movie, Finding Dory. But when we say she's loved by Disney, we mean they absolutely adore her. The role was created specifically for her, and no one else. She even has her own ride in Disney World Florida called Ellen's Energy Adventure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>She has her own ride in Disney World Florida called Ellen's Energy Adventure. The role of Dory was created specifically for her.</strong></p><p>While it's reportedly not the best ride in the park, people still seem to love it. Unfortunately, the audio-animatronic version of her has since been removed. Apparently, on the ride the robot version of Ellen could be seen fighting off a dinosaur, who had stopped working as well. Once the dinosaur was removed, Ellen seemed out of place, just fighting with, well, the air. It was taken down, and the clothes and skin were bought by a Disney collector, who then presented it to the real life Ellen on her birthday, on air. It's a bummer that her ride has been through so much, even being shut down on several occasions. But Disney is not giving up yet, and they will always have a warm space in their heart for Ellen.</p><h2 id=she-s-related-to-royalty-and-madonna><strong>She's Related To Royalty And Madonna</strong></h2><p>Did you know that Ellen is related to the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton? It's true! They are 14th cousins, twice removed, which means they're pretty far apart, but it's interesting nonetheless! According to E News,&nbsp;they are related through a man named Sir Thomas Fairfax and his wife, Agnes Gascoigne, who lived in the United Kingdom in the early 1500s. Apparently Ellen wants to meet with the Duchess, but Kate Middleton hasn't commented on the relation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“She refuses to admit it and I don’t know why. But I am going to be at Wimbledon and if my cousin Kate is there I’m going to bring the DNA chart with me.”</strong></p><p>While we're on the subject of interesting, unexpected relatives, Ellen is also related to Madonna! Ancestry says, "Family history experts at Ancestry uncovered that the two entertainment giants are related through a common 10th great-grandfather — a Frenchman named Martin Aucoin. In the early 1600s, Aucoin’s daughters Jeanne and Michele left their native country of France to settle in Nova Scotia, where both Madonna and Ellen’s families remained for several generations."</p><p>"DeGeneres’s family left Canada in the late 1700s when her 5th great-grandfather Joseph Martin relocated to Louisiana. It wasn’t until the late 1870s that Madonna’s 2nd great-grandmother Emilie Daniel left Quebec and crossed the “borderline” to Michigan, where the singer herself calls home."</p><h2 id=being-an-icon><strong>Being An Icon</strong></h2><p>Ellen came out of the closet over twenty years ago. The public perception of homosexuals in 1996 was far different from what we know today today. What she did took courage, and her influence continues to foster a growing acceptance of homosexuality. She came out on her show, Ellen, in 1997. Many sponsors pulled their advertising, and she was ostracized by religious conservatives. The entire ordeal landed her on the front cover of Time magazine. Jessica Halem, a fellow comedian and gay rights activist had this to say about Ellen,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"What's wonderful about her, as a cultural figure, is that it worked so wonderfully alongside political activism. There's political activism and cultural change going on at the same time."</strong></p><p>"That scene is just so beautiful, because there's nothing like telling someone you're gay and then it goes silent. But for her to say, 'I'm gay' and it's a laugh line, and you know it lets us laugh, it lets us release some of the anxiety." She continues to be an advocate for the gay community and an inspiration to those that are fearful of receiving backlash for who they are. She is one of the most influential people to publicly come out of the closet in history.</p><h2 id=she-was-kicked-out><strong>She Was Kicked Out</strong></h2><p>When Ellen officially came out, she was living with her father and stepmother. She first broke the news to her father, who she states was accepting of who she was, but did not understand it. Regardless, he loved her unconditionally, but he did not want to talk about it much. Her stepmother, on the other hand, took a more drastic approach.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ellen went on Oprah to talk about her coming out story, and the affect it had on her family. She said, "My father, it was a little harder because he’s very religious and I thought he would have a hard time with it. But he’s the kind of guy [who says], ‘I love you for whoever you are, but I don’t understand it. Let’s never talk about it again.’"</p><p>"They asked me to move out of the house. [My stepmom] had two little girls that they worried that it would influence them. [It] really hurt. I loved them. But, I understood it. I understand people not understanding. I’m fine with that. I can’t change anyone’s mind."</p><p>Her family was accepting, to a certain degree. Of course, being religious, and not fully understanding homosexuality made their relationship a little strained. It seems Ellen was just as loving and caring of other people's choices, even when being asked to move away from her family.</p><h2 id=her-past-relationship><strong>Her Past Relationship</strong></h2><p>We already know that Ellen tragically lost her ex-girlfriend, Kat Perkoff, in a car accident when she was around twenty years old. But according to the National Enquirer, there may be more to the story than most people know. Kat Perkoff didn't just manage a bar. She allegedly was a notorious trafficker as well. Ralph Whalen, a former assistant district attorney said, “Talk in the community was that it had been a hit – that she was killed." In fact, even Kat's sister suspected foul play.&nbsp;She told the National Enquirer, "“Kat was a runaway, a poet, an entrepreneurial trafficker and Ellen’s first love,” Rachel says. “The official report of the New Orleans Police Department states that Kat’s death was caused by accidental collision.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I suppose we'll never really know the truth behind Kat's passing, but the rumors alone are sure to be enough to keep Ellen awake some nights. She confesses that she feels guilty over the entire ordeal. Losing someone close to you is never easy, and although Ellen seems like a hero, she is still human, after all.</p><h2 id=always-wanted-to-be-a-homeowner><strong>Always Wanted To Be A Homeowner</strong></h2><p>Ellen is obsessed with buying houses. According to Vogue, she's purchased fifteen houses in the last twenty five years! Degeneres told Architectural Digest,</p><p><strong>“We never had a house when I was growing up. We always rented. But my father would dream, and we used to look at houses all the time."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The first thing I did when I made money was buy a house." Though she typically ends up selling the houses and leaving, she doesn't consider herself a flipper. When The New York Times brought this up, she asserted, “I’ve never bought to sell. I always say: ‘This is it. I’m never moving.’ People laugh at me now.” Who can blame her. With an annual salary of $75 million, why wouldn't she buy new, beautiful houses and furnish them? Even more comical than her swearing that "this is it," is the fact that fake tabloid news was blasting everywhere that Portia was leaving her over their constant moving. Ellen told People in February of 2013, "Which is funny because she is overseeing the construction of our new house and loving it.” The couple likes living in luxury, and I would imagine that getting a fresh new home every couple of years isn't really so bad when you're moving out of choice, and not necessity. She sure has come up quite a bit from her childhood.</p><h2 id=college-drop-out><strong>College Drop Out</strong></h2><p>The words "college dropout" have such a negative connotation, but I certainly don't mean it that way, especially when it comes to Ellen Degeneres. Yes, Ellen dropped out of college after only one semester. She moved back to New Orleans to attend the University of New Orleans, majoring in Communications Studies. She was featured in LifeHack's article, "15 Inspiring College Dropouts Who Prove Hard Work is the Way to Success." I couldn't have put it better myself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Ellen didn't finish and get a degree, she has the smarts and the know how to create an empire for herself, that much is clear. She simply didn't enjoy college, and honestly, can you blame her? I don't think anyone really enjoys class. When she dropped out, she went through several part-time jobs, all while pursuing a career in comedy and acting. Most of the time she would accept low or even no-pay jobs performing at various comedy clubs after work. For almost ten years she didn't see much return on her hard work, but obviously it paid off eventually! She started touring, but the real break in her career was when she appeared on Johnny Carson. More on that later, though.</p><h2 id=unsure-about-her-future><strong>Unsure About Her Future</strong></h2><p>Like many of us, Ellen didn't always know what she wanted to do with her life. Her story is the epitome self-made success. As we've already covered, Ellen dropped out of college after one semester. She moved back home to do clerical work at a law firm with her cousin for a while, eventually moving on to other various low-paying jobs. She was an associate at JC Penny, a waitress at TGI Friday's, she painted houses, and she even sold vacuum cleaners. There was even a time that she considered becoming a professional golfer. She started her career in comedy by performing at small venues in the 1980s, and it took her a long time to</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>After one semester of college, she dropped out to do clerical work at a law firm with her cousin. She also worked as an associate at a J.C. Penny, waitressed at TGIF Friday's, painted houses, and even sold vacuum cleaners.</strong></p><p>At one time, she thought about becoming a professional golfer. She got her start in comedy at small venues in the 1980s, but there were many small odd jobs before that. It's refreshing to know you're not alone in your search for a career you're passionate about.</p><h2 id=she-impressed-johnny-carson><strong>She Impressed Johnny Carson</strong></h2><p>Ellen's big break happened when she made a guest appearance on The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson. Not only did she kill her bit, she was the only female comic ever asked to sit next to Johnny after her performance. It was absolutely huge, and it could be argued that it was a significant moment in history for women everywhere. Johnny Carson was legendary, and the honor she felt and the attention she received after sitting with him took her career to the next level.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ellen was given only five minutes to impress the audience, and naturally, she did it right off the bat. She performed her "Dialed God" bit, and it was killer. I mean, she just nailed it. She was inspired to write that bit after the tragic loss of her girlfriend so it had more meaning to her than most people would understand. It's beyond sad that she lost someone so close to her, at such a young age. No one should have to go through that, ever. But it certainly led to a big moment in her life, as the famous Johnny Carson was blown away by the bit inspired by the tragedy.</p><h2 id=peta-named-her-woman-of-the-year><strong>Peta Named Her Woman Of The Year</strong></h2><p>Did you know Ellen is a vegan? Most people don't, unless you watch her show religiously. She's an animal lover and an animal rights advocate. In fact, she wanted to be a veterinarian when she was young. She's always owned many pets. We're not sure how many she currently has, but in June of 2017 she told Good Housekeeping that she owns six pets. She's even lived on a farm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I have three dogs (Wolf, Augie, and Kid) and three cats (Charlie, George, and Chairman). I would tell you more about them, but like any celebrity parent, I think it's important to keep them out of the press. Do I have a favorite? I couldn't possibly answer that! It's Charlie."</strong></p><p>She lets her pets sleep in the bed with her and her wife, Portia, though she claims that it's more like they let she and her wife sleep in the bed with them. PETA says they named her the woman of the year in 2009 for many reasons. "Ever since she and her wife, Portia De Rossi, decided to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ditch all animal products</a> in 2008, Ellen has made sure that her wildly popular talk show includes features to raise people’s awareness of animal issues. [She] also created pages on her Web site that feature insight, info, and tips about cruelty-free living. Visitors can find recipes, read about why Ellen went vegan, learn where to shop, and more."</p><h2 id=doesn-t-want-kids><strong>Doesn't Want Kids</strong></h2><p>According to Ellen, people are constantly asking her when she and her wife, Portia are going to have children. No matter how many times they have stated that they don't plan on having kids, rumors still fly around constantly. Media outlets will claim that Portia is pregnant, or that she' leaving Ellen because she wants kids. Of course, none of it is ever true. Ellen told Sunday Style,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"We talked about it for a minute, about four years into the relationship, but we just decided we like our conversations not being interrupted and our furniture without sticky grape juice on it."</strong></p><p>She also said she thinks the entertainment industry is hard for children because they "have to share their parents with the world." As a parent, I have to say, I totally get it. My couch is constantly covered in grape juice, and most days consist of cleaning the same messes over and over again, and not being able to finish a conversation with my husband. I wouldn't trade it for the world, but I won't deny that it's difficult at times. One can only imagine what it's like to be a celebrity juggling motherhood and an intense career.</p><h2 id=she-s-written-four-books><strong>She's Written Four Books</strong></h2><p>Most people are unaware that Ellen has written four books. Her first book, My Point, And I Do Have One was published in 1995. Since then she has published The Funny Thing Is, Seriously... I'm Kidding, and Home. Her latest book, Home, was published in 2015, and it's all about&nbsp;— you guessed it&nbsp;— interior design. With the amount of times Ellen has moved and redecorated her houses, it's only fitting that she write a book on the subject. Amazon's description of this book states,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"In <i>Home</i>, DeGeneres will, for the first time, share her passion for home design and style. She believes, 'You don't have to have money to have good taste,' and she is eager to share what she has learned over the years.</strong></p><p>DeGeneres offers a personal look at every room in each of her homes. Included are seven of her homes past and present, from the famous "Brody House" up to her current homes, and she offers tips and advice on what each house taught her." Degeneres' other recent book, Seriously, I'm Kidding, is also loved by many. It's described as hilarious and reviewers say it's as if she's having a conversation with you. Ellen's mother, Betty has also written a book. And it's all about Ellen!&nbsp;She's her number one fan, that's for sure.</p><h2 id=she-had-a-small-wedding><strong>She Had A Small Wedding</strong></h2><p>Even though Ellen and Portia are crazy wealthy, they had a small, intimate wedding with only nineteen guests! Who could have guessed it? Well, I guess we all could have. No matter how famous and successful Ellen has become, she's always remained grounded and laid-back. They claimed that planning a big wedding was far too stressful. The most extravagant part of their wedding was their matching designer outfits. Their wedding took place two months after gay marriage was legalized in the United States, and it was a private affair at their lovely LA home, though she later aired her wedding video. She didn't go out of her way to keep things hidden from the public, she simply wanted the day itself to be special and low key. Rossi said that getting married was never something that they took for granted. "That we get to do this, it means a lot." Degeneres brought the comic relief of course.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"She’s now officially off the market. No one else gets her. And now she’ll cook and clean for me.”</strong></p><p>Ellen is an inspiration, and it's so refreshing to see her come so far and still remain the same person she's always been. Fans adore her for moments like this. She seems so real, so authentic, and it's one of her best qualities.</p><h2 id=she-had-a-man><strong>She Had A&nbsp;Man</strong></h2><p>In the early 1990s, Ellen was often accompanied by actor Johnathon Schaech. Schaech would be seen attending galas, red carpet events, and awards ceremonies with Ellen. Recently, at age 46, Schaech came forward and spoke about their outings.</p><p>“My manager asked me to accompany her to events. She was scared people would not watch the show, her sitcom ‘Ellen,’ because she was gay,” stated Schaech.</p><p>Schaech even grew up with a gay uncle and two lesbian aunts, so it is no wonder he later blew the whistle on his manager's request to have hime act as Ellen's man at public events. He admires Ellen and is happy that society has come so far regarding the LGBTQ community over the past twenty years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My aunt died of cancer. She was a proud woman and she didn’t get proper care because she didn’t want to be away from her partner. When you have someone you love in your life that is gay or a lesbian it’s very clear that they deserve the same rights as anyone else."</p><p>It was a different time, as recent as it sounds. Thankfully, most Americans seem to have changed their tune in regards to homosexuality. It truly is interesting though, to look back at Ellen's early days, when she wasn't even able to admit who she really was.</p><p>References:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Huffingtonpost.com</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Closerweekly.com</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rollingstone.com</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eonline.com</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newidea.com</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Peta.org</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGK%2Fpq3SqKWsZZWhuaa6jJ2coJ2emr%2Bmv4yiqqesXay1sHnWnmStoJmjuG6%2Fx55koqtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
