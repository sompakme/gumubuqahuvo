For now, specific details about the brand’s latest model are being kept under tight wraps. But Polestar has said consumers shouldn’t simply expect an upgrade of the Polestar 3. Rather, the new model is a whole breed of its own.</p><p>“Polestar 4 is not simply a modified version of our first SUV. Instead, we reconsidered the entire design to create a new breed of SUV coupé,” <a href=#>Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath has said</a> .</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Polestar’s three pillars – design, innovation, and sustainability – are evident in its latest model. Polestar 3 and 4 demonstrate the brand’s commitment to prioritizing both technology and efficiency alongside sustainability and style.&nbsp;Impressively, Polestar has incorporated unique ways to make their models as eco-friendly as possible, even using recycle materials (like fish netting) in Polestar 3’s doors.</p><p>It may have just been announced, but the Polestar 4 is on track to being the company’s fastest production car to date, which speaks to the growing demand for electric vehicles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the first half of 2022 alone, <a href=#>Polestar reported that their sales increased by 125%</a> -- and with its two newest&nbsp;models launching within months of each other, there’s seemingly no reason this trend won’t continue.</p><p>The Polestar 3, which has been compared in size to the Porsche Cayenne, is <a href=#>expected to launch in U.S. stores later this year</a>, while Polestar 4 is expected to come nine months after.</p><p>The Polestar 4 will be more of a traditional SUV, and comes with a lower price tag, as it starts around $60,000. Comparatively, the Polestar 3 is said to start around $85,300.</p><p>With Polestar considered one of the more luxurious electric vehicle brands, it’s no surprise the company is a favorite amongst celebrities, <a href=#>including Sylvester Stallone</a> as well as Leonardo DiCaprio, <a href=#>who’s previously invested in the company</a>, which is unsurprising given his history of environmentalism and climate activism. It likely won’t be long before many famous faces are driving their own Polestar 3 or 4 on the road.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez Faces Intense Backlash After Launching Alcohol Brand</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Polestar</a>, <a href=#>Polestar</a>, <a href=#>Car Scoops</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8uur66qqWKyrbHCramim12owrd5z6ijnquklr9ugIydnJutpKh6or%2BMm6mappSoeqet0q2crKxdpb%2BwsNScq6KnnmKwor6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
