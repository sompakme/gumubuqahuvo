Initially, she thought that the attorney was a prank caller, but she agreed to take his number down.</p><p>“The next day, he called me back…the only condition that he had was that he didn’t want to call the book ‘I Did It,'” the further explained. “He wanted to put an ‘if’ in front of it, so that he would have deniability with his children. He couldn’t face his children, and he couldn’t tell them that he had done it. That was the way it was portrayed to me, that was his only confession.”</p><p>O.J. was acquitted of the murders in 1995, in what was deemed the “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">trial of the century</a>.” In October 2017, Simpson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was released </a>from prison <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on parole</a>, after serving nine years for burglary and kidnapping charges, which were unrelated to the murders.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>//cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/591531/sp/59153100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/6740162/partner_id/591531?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player_1413478522&entry_id=0_a7t7xjea</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6S3br%2FIpqesp55ir7C7ymanrpqcnsCpsdFmmqimlprAtLXOp2Rub2JmfnR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
