She was born on December 10 2014, in the United States of America. Lieberher’s zodiac sign is Sagittarius, and she has an American nationality. She is currently 9 years old. Lieberher’s hair colour is light brown. Jovi Lieberher’s parent’s name is Wes Lieberher and Angela Martell. Her siblings are Jaeden Lieberher, Sydney Quinn Lieberher and Hayes Lieberher.

Jovi was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, with three siblings.</p><p>Jovi and her family are famous for her brother, Jaeden, a renowned actor. There is not much information about Jovi’s educational status, but she might have completed Kindergarten and probably would be planning to attend school at her age. Jovi Lieberher is too young to have love affairs or work in any field. She might be studying currently, so she has no earnings or net worth. But we feel that the way her brother Jaeden has been doing things likewise, she will do something great one day. Jovi is an adorable and beautiful kid.
