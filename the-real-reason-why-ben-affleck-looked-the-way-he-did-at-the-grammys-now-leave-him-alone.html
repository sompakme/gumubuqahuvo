It's entirely possible that the reason he looked as he did at the Grammy's is because he's simply been working too hard. After all, two of those movies are due out this summer. So before we start speculating about Affleck's health, let's give him a break. He's obviously under a lot of pressure right now, and he deserves our support, not our judgment.</p><h2 id=ben-affleck-39-s-recent-appearance-at-the-grammy-awards>Ben Affleck's Recent Appearance At The Grammy Awards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/screenshot-2023-02-06-9-10-45-pm.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ben Affleck's recent appearance at the Grammy's caused many people to speculate about his health and well-being. The actor has been open about his struggles with alcohol addiction in the past and fans thought he might be having a relapse. Affleck looked<a href=#> visibly tired at the event</a>, with glassy eyes and appearing to space out at times. Hence leading some fans to believe that he was struggling with addiction or boredom, while others speculated about his overall health and well-being. Fans commented on the viral pics with no shame (per usual) saying things like, “He can’t keep up with her demands.” “He is high as a kite.” And “They won’t make it.” Funny how people can tell all of that from one picture.</p><h2 id=is-ben-affleck-still-sober>Is Ben Affleck Still Sober?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/screenshot-2023-02-06-9-18-27-pm.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ben Affleck has struggled with his mental health and <a href=#>a horrible alcohol addiction</a> in the past. Alcohol abuse takes a toll on the body, both physically and mentally. It is hard on the liver and can cause premature aging. In addition to the physical effects, alcohol abuse can also lead to anxiety and depression.</p><p>Affleck claims to have strung together 365+ days of sobriety; one day at a time. Did he relapse? It’s possible, but it’s nobody else's business how he fights his demons. Alcoholism is not something anyone chooses for themselves. Ben Affleck put his rabid dog in a cage and antagonized it by walking around freely without needing it. Do you know what happens if that dog gets loose? It is bigger, badder, and madder than before. Of course, the dog is the disease in this metaphor. Falling off the wagon can be compared to falling into the deepest level of darkness there is as far as what it can do mentally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Are Matt Damon And Ben Affleck Still BFFs Amid Rumors Matt Doesn't Like JLo?">Are Matt Damon And Ben Affleck Still BFFs Amid Rumors Matt Doesn't Like JLo?</a></span></p><p>In 2020, <a href=#>Ben gave an interview</a> to The New York Times about his sobriety and challenges and is quoted saying, “People with compulsive behavior, and I am one, have this kind of basic discomfort all the time that they’re trying to make go away, you’re trying to make yourself feel better with eating or drinking or gambling or shopping or whatever. But that ends up making your life worse. Then you do more of it to make that discomfort go away. Then the real pain starts. It becomes a vicious cycle you can’t break. That’s at least what happened to me.”</p><p>So does Ben Affleck <a href=#>look like he relapsed?</a> Yes. Weight loss, sweating heavily, tired, swollen eyes, and looking like he is going to lose his lunch when he stands up. All signs of detox, however, that can all be the sign of a virus too, or working too much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ben-affleck-has-three-movies-in-the-making-right-now>Ben Affleck Has Three Movies In The Making Right Now</h2><p>Ben has three movies in the making right now. <a href=#>The Flash</a> (June 16, 2023), <a href=#>Oppenheimer</a> (July 21, 2023), and <a href=#>Aquaman</a> and the Last Kingdom (December 25, 2023). It's not uncommon for actors to look exhausted when they're working on multiple films, the former Batman is certainly not the first one to go through this and he will not be the last. So, that could be a reason Affleck appeared as he did at the event.</p><p>Now, if you have been following along, you know that fans were devastated in 2004, when the original Bennifer broke up. It was painful to see them move on with their lives at first. Everyone thought for sure they would get back together. Alas,<a href=#> it took 18 years for them</a> to find their way back to each other. It is unfathomable that Affleck would do anything to mess that up now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes down to it, they caught a couple bad angles of Ben. It happens, they just aren’t always dropped into the possession of the media. Let’s be thankful for those who got the great photos they did, and for <a href=#>JLo herself taking to Instagram </a>with footage of the happy couple, captioning it with, “Always the best time with my husband.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipnpmcYr%2BmrdKopWavmK56o7HNZpifnpyasKx5y6impJ2UYsGpsYywmLJlmJp6pbXDZp6rmZ2ixrR5yZ6lp6GWmr9uuM6pnLNn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
