The horse-dance artist opened the door for new artists such as Black Pink and BTS to join the American music industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>10 Expensive Things Owned By Mark Zuckerberg&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>As one of the most relevant achievements of the South Korean genre, Black Pink became the first K-Pop girl group to perform at Coachella, the biggest music festival in the US. Regarding boy groups, BTS was the first K-pop male group to perform at the American Music Awards with their song DNA. However, "Gangnam Style" became the first YouTube video to exceed 1 billion views which generated the singer&nbsp;$8.8 million during 2012.</p><h2 id=rolls-royce-red-phantom---450-000>Rolls-Royce Red Phantom -$450.000</h2><p>The Phantom is considered an ultimate status symbol.

The apartment has 2,700 square feet of living space. The building was constructed in 1989, but the house looks newer than that, especially the big and luxurious bathroom. The kitchen is very sophisticated as well with beautiful wood furnishings. Also, there are floor-to-ceiling windows in several rooms. The building also comes with some nice perks, including a pool and concierge service <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a> reports.</p><h2 id=coffee-shop-in-seoul---50-million>Coffee Shop in Seoul -$50 million</h2><p>Coffee is considered a strong element in Korean culture, so much that it is common for celebrities to own restaurants and cafés. Even the entertainment companies themselves have their coffee shops. The amount of fanaticism toward this custom makes Seoul's coffee per capita greater than Seattle or San Francisco.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hulk Likes Green: 10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Mark Ruffalo Bought</a></span></p><p>It is an estimate of 49,600 coffee shops in South Korea and 17,000 coffee shops in Seoul according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Host Fiera Milano</a>.&nbsp;The name of PSY's coffee place is Takeout Drawing, an independent coffee shop and art gallery in Seoul's Itaewon district.

In the western world, weddings take place in humble locations such as churches and backyards. Even if the cost of the wedding depends on where the couple tied the knot, hotels are the most expensive venues for weddings at an average cost of more than $22,000. PSY married his wife Yoo Hye-Yeon&nbsp;after three and a half years of dating in 2006. At that time, she was a student at Yonsei University as a solo major.
