And, he changed his mind about his house of his dreams, which popped up for sale this week with a price tag of $3.3 million.</p><p>It’s a glute-firming hike up sun-dappled flagstone paved walkways from the street-level two-car garage to the two-story residence that appears little altered since Anstead acquired it. Connected by an interior staircase, the cottage contains two independent living spaces, each with its own kitchen and living area, that together measure almost 2,000 square feet with a total of three bedrooms and two bathrooms.</p><p>The two-bedroom and one-bath upper floor is bright and airy with vaulted open-beam ceilings, an original brick fireplace in the living room, and an updated kitchen. A sea breezy wraparound deck provides plenty of room for al fresco lounging and entertaining.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Downstairs, the one-bedroom, one-bath lower level opens to the front yard and showcases colorful Talavera tile accents. The living room is large enough to accommodate a baby grand piano and the kitchen is simply updated with a porcelain farmhouse sink and a vintage range.</p><p>Anstead’s unique property, which is charming enough just as it is but also offers much potential, is available through Azita Sadeghi at Compass.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>A$AP Bari Sued More Than $30,000 Due To Car Accident Damages</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>She Knows</a>, <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaapqRirq%2B%2F056YnWWWpL%2BusdFmo5qfpaOubq7EmpqhZZOkwbWtxp5knaqVlrputM6uqp5lnJ7Atb%2BMn6arZWNigG65yKWjoqeeZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
