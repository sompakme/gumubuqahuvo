Similar to reports, Marlene fainted during a fatal ‘Grand Prix’ crash when she saw Niki’s burns and his bruised eyelids.</p><p>Considered the “it girl,” she was recognized during that period for her impeccable sense of fashion and signature loose hairdo, which became a trend. In the 2013 film ‘Rush,’ which focused primarily on the rivalry between Niki and fellow ‘Formula 1’ driver James Hunt during the 1976 ‘Formula 1’ motor-racing season, actors Alexandra Maria and Daniel Brühl played Marlene and Niki respectively.</p><p>The movie reveals that Marlene had no idea of Niki’s stardom at first. Alexandra performed beautifully in the movie with the trademark of Marlene’s loose top knot bun hairstyle. When visiting “Rush” sets, Niki saw Alexandra from a distance in her full Marlene persona, exclaiming” Marlene! Marlene!”</p><p>Married to Niki Lauda for a long time, the couple has two sons together, Lukas Lauda and Mathias Lauda.</p><table width=604><tbody readability=4.5><tr readability=2><td>Boyfriends</td><td width=481>Andreas Nikolaus “Niki” Lauda</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Marital Status</td><td width=481>Married once (Divorced now)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Husband</td><td width=481 readability=5>Andreas Nikolaus “Niki” Lauda (from 1976-1991)<p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Marlene-Knaus-Wiki-Niki-Laudas-Ex-Wife-Bio-Age-Family-Facts-300x170.jpg></p></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td width=481 readability=5><strong>Son –</strong> Lukas Lauda, Mathias Lauda<p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Andreas-Nikolaus-Niki-Lauda.jpg></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here we provide you the list of Marlene Knaus’s favorite things.</p><table width=576><tbody readability=1><tr><td>Favorite Actors</td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Actress</td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Colour</td><td width=350>Pink</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Favorite Holiday Destinations</td><td width=350>Miami</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Food</td><td width=350>Italian Cuisine</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Things To Do</td><td width=350>Shopping, and Travelling</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>Marlene was born in America but belongs to Austrian nationality.</li></ul><ul><li>Her husband had won the 1975, 1977 and 1984 World Driver Championship.</li></ul><ul><li>She currently lives in a home in Ibiza which she acquired from her ex-husband after her divorce.</li></ul><ul><li>She was considered an Icon of fashion in her days.</li></ul><ul><li>She stayed in touch with her ex-husband for a few years following their divorce.</li></ul><ul><li>In 1997, Niki was given a kidney from his brother Florian Lauda but in 2005 it stopped working.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLXKopmip16qwHC5wKujnqaVYrivrdSsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
