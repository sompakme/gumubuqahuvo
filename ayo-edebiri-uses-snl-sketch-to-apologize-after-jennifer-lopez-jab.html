The audio captured by&nbsp;TMZ&nbsp;features Ayo discussing J.

During a sketch of a parody game show called,&nbsp;Why’d Ya Say It?,&nbsp;Kenan Thompson asked Ayo’s character about her social media comments.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Thompson questioned why she’d typed “die” underneath a video of Drew Barrymore dancing in the rain. Edebiri’s character then nervously shouted and explained why they were saying “mean” comments about people they didn’t know. She seemingly used that moment to also address the Lopez incident.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“OK, OK, we get it,” she said. “It’s wrong to leave mean comments, or post comments just for clout, or run your mouth on a podcast and you don’t consider the impact because you’re 24 and stupid. From now on we’re going to be a lot more thoughtful about what we post online.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, Edebiri didn’t let her past actions disrupt her big day. During her opening monologue, the actress celebrated the fact that she was hosting one of her favorite shows. Ayo referred to the moment as a “dream come true.” The Emmy Award-winning entertainer commemorated her career milestone and even made some history along the way.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m so excited to be here.&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;means so much to me. <a href=#>This really is a dream come true</a>,” Edebiri said, getting choked up. “I was born and raised in Boston which makes me the first Black woman to ever admit that. Three days into February, and I’m already making Black history.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>not Ayo Edebiri&nbsp;addressing her resurfaced jokes about Jennifer Lopez’s whole career being a scam during an SNL sketch lol</p><p>“Okay.
