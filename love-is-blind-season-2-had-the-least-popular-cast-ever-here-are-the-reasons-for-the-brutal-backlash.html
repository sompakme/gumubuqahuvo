Every season has unique pod dates, declarations of love, and worries that both partners won't say yes on their wedding day. But <a href=#>LIB season 2 had some awkward moments</a> that stood out, along with cast members who fans feel negatively about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like in season 1, two couples in season 2 got married, and fans had high hopes for Danielle Ruhl and Nick Thompson. Jarrette Jones and Iyanna McNeely seemed to have a real connection as well. Sadly, both of these couples announced their divorces shortly before the After the Altar special. And while fans will never give up on the fun of watching Love Is Blind, season 2 had some unpopular cast members.</p><h2 id=shake-chatterjee-upset-fans-who-watched-him-treat-deepti-vempati-badly>Shake Chatterjee Upset Fans Who Watched Him Treat Deepti Vempati Badly</h2><p>The <a href=#>Love Is Blind season 2 cast has regrets</a>, which makes sense given some of the poor behavior on the series. While of course people watch reality shows to see some melodramatic moments and memorable fights, fans didn't like the way that Shake Chatterjee treated Deepti Vempati, and this became one of the most discussed parts of these episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the couple had a connection while talking in the pods, once they traveled to Mexico and spent time together in real life, Shake didn't seem pleased. From the beginning, Shake said that he wasn't physically attracted to Deepti, but continued with the show. He made her feel insecure and terrible about herself, and it was hard to see this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Shake-and-Deepti-Love-is-Blind.jpg><p>Shake upset fans from the start, as when he was in the pods, he said that he wanted to date a woman who he could put on his shoulders at a concert. This was only one of the many rude comments that he made about wanting to date women who don't weigh very much. There are several Reddit threads devoted to talking about Shake, and most are negative.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans cheered when Deepti said no at the altar and explained that she had to choose herself, and when Shake learned that their relationship was over, he mentioned that he would be fine because he had reservations at Nobu.</p><p>A fan shared on Reddit that was a "super cringy" thing to say, with another writing, "Shake 1000% does not deserve Deepti."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How 'Love Is Blind' Season 2 Changed Their Casting Approach</a></span></p><p>Shake has been open about his experience on Love Is Blind and knows that people find his behavior problematic. He participated in an Ask Me Anything on Reddit after the series aired and wrote in his description, "Veterinarian. DJ. Mindset Coach. Currently the most hated person in America."</p><p>Redditors asked Shake why he said that he was attracted to Deepti at first and then said that he wasn't and why he continued to speak about her after the show aired.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/love-is-blind-season-2-shake-deepti.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deepti spoke about Shake in her book</a> "I Choose Myself" and when at the Love Is Blind season 2 reunion, she was confident and told him that his attitude and words are inappropriate. She said, "It's how you do it and how you say it that's extremely disrespectful. It's degrading to women. I'm so happy for every single person sitting on this couch today because they have my back and they call you out."</p><p>Fans were thrilled to see Deepti standing up for herself and this was one of the most inspiring moments from the whole series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shake started a podcast called "Life Is Blurry" and said that he was frustrated that his co-stars were speaking out against his behavior. He said, "I was so hurt and upset by how everything happened. Everybody [was] just like, ‘Oh you’re the villain. All right, peace, dude. We don’t want to be friends with you,'" according to Us Weekly.</p><h2 id=love-is-blind-fans-had-a-problem-with-shaina-hurley>Love Is Blind Fans Had A Problem With Shaina Hurley</h2><p>If Shake was an unpopular Love Is Blind season 2 cast member, Shaina Hurley made waves for the part that she played in Natalie Lee and Shayne Jansen's relationship. From the get-go, Shaina was a tough, open person who would say whatever she wanted to.</p><p>Shayne admitted that he had feelings for both women while in the pods and things got super messy when he and Natalie got engaged. When Shayne and Shaina saw each other at a group party later on in the season, she shared her thoughts about his relationship, making it clear that she didn't think he and Natalie would make it work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/love-is-blind-season-2-shaina-hurley-pods.jpg><p>Fans hated this moment, as it felt unfair to Natalie, who was doing her best to get to know Shayne and decide if she felt that she could move forward with him or not.</p><p>The drama got even more intense during the After The Altar special when Natalie said that Shayne and Shaina flirted via text messages while he and Natalie were together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Love Is Blind's Shayne Jansen's Exes Had A Lot To Say About The Reality Star</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shayne denied flirting with Shaina</a> and, according to Us Weekly, he said, "I don’t fully understand what was scandalous about me and Shaina DMing each other, you know, I see a Story [and] I comment. When it comes to Natalie, if I blinked at Shaina, it would probably be ‘scandalous.’ She never was able to move on from it. Never.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Love Is Blind fans were also unsure about Shaina because she got engaged to Kyle Abrams when it was obvious that she didn't have real feelings for him. She also left him when they were in Mexico and went home early.</p><p>Shaina said that she continued with the relationship because she felt it was important for Kyle to talk to her family so she could see how they were together. She told Us Weekly, “I’m very close with my family and I knew that they know what’s best for me at the end of the day. And so when I saw them interact and, like, what my parents’ reaction was, it kind of sealed the deal for me. I didn’t wanna make any mistakes.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/love-is-blind-season-2-shayne-shaina.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans also wondered why Shaina seemed to squint so much on Love Is Blind. She shared on Instagram Stories that this is just the way that she has always been: according to Us Weekly, she wrote “I wear contacts, OK? I’ve been squinting ever since I can remember."</p><h2 id=love-is-blind-season-2-was-an-unpopular-cast-in-general>Love Is Blind Season 2 Was An Unpopular Cast In General</h2><p>While fans are going to have opinions about any reality cast members, some viewers were unhappy with the Love Is Blind season 2 cast and felt that it wasn't the strongest one.</p><p>One fan wrote on Reddit, "S2 was the worst. I couldn't connect with most of them and always had the feeling that nothing was authentic."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Were The Rules On 'Love Is Blind' Season 2</a></span></p><p>A fan said "I didn’t root for really anybody on S2" and another wrote, "Season 2 was the least engaging to me." While Love Is Blind fans continue to support Deepti and love hearing what she has to say about self-love and confidence, not everyone from this cast is as beloved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijqK6VYra0ecGloKecXaiyor%2FOp2RrZZOWwLV5wqilraqfq7Kzv9hmrqGZpGK1orzPnqWenF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
