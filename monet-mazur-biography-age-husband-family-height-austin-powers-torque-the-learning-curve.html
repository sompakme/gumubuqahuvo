Lee, Executive Editor for Radio Free Entertainment<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;radiofree.com</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><p><strong>RadioFree.com: How did you get involved in this film?</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><p>MONET: I did a magazine shoot and an article for this English magazine, and when it came out, I was so unhappy with it. [laughs] I hated the pictures, and the interview was such a horrible depiction of who I was and what I actually said in the interview. And I just thought, “Oh, God, what trash! I’m never going to do one of those magazines again.” And the director had seen it and read it, and went, “That’s Anita.” So it’s really funny because he sent me this letter attached to the script saying, “I saw you in this magazine and I haven’t found anyone yet that looks like Anita at all. You have to play this part. Please read the script and tell me what you think.” And I just saw Anita Pallenberg, Brian Jones, Stones, Stephen Woolley…And I just went, “Yes! Tell them yes!” And then I read it and I thought, “This is going to be fun and challenging and scary, and for all different reasons.” And the cast, too. To do an English movie like that with such an amazing British cast…It’s really exciting for me.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span></p><p><strong>When you say you were unhappy with the photoshoot, are you just being modest?</strong></p><p>No, it wasn’t like, “Oh, I don’t like the way they lit me.” It was like…They came out very sort of raunchy. They weren’t exactly what I thought we had shot. “Raunchy” is a bit extreme, but they were a little bit too sexy. And it was very Anita-ish, I guess. [laughs]</p><p><strong>Had director Stephen Woolley seen your previous film roles?</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span></p><p>No, he actually didn’t know my work at all. And so he read the article, and then, I guess, looked me up, and then went and watched a bunch of my movies, and wrote me this letter. And I happened to be going to London on my way to a trip to Israel the week that they were going to start rehearsals. And he said, “Can I meet you?” And I met him at this hotel in the lobby, and I came down the stairs, and he just sorts of looked at me and went, “You look like Anita…Did you cut your hair like that because you knew you were going to meet me today?” And I said, “No.” Everything about this movie is one big, weird coincidence.</p><p><strong>Speaking of which, is it true that your father designed the lips/tongue logo for the Rolling Stones that we’re all familiar with?</strong></p><p>Yeah. It’s just a really weird coincidence.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span></p><p><strong>So did you grow up with a love of the Stones?</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_15"></span></p><p>I definitely had a love of music, and my parents were sort of eccentric, cool people from the ’70s, the ’60s. And there was always music around, and I was always encouraged to play music and listen to music. But I really sort of found my own kind of taste and genres that I got into as I became a teenager. But the Stones were always a big musical [presence].</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span><br><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span></p>Martin Henderson Age, Wiki, Wife, G… <span class=vjs-icon-placeholder></span><p></p><p class=vjs-no-js>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Martin Henderson Age, Wiki, Wife, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Family</p><p><strong>Would you say you lived in a “free spirit” type of household as a kid?</strong></p><p>No, it was very normal…School and playing at friends’ houses. I just had a cool mom. I mean, she wasn’t like, “Here, have some pot brownies!” or anything like that. [laughs] But she was young and hip, and definitely up to the moment. So she definitely had her stories from back in the day, which I always got a kick out of.</p><p><strong>How do you feel about that whole ’60s/’70s rock revolution era?</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span></p><p>I love it. I’m obsessed. I think I really was, honestly, born at the wrong time, because everything about the way I dress, and my hair’s like permanently stuck in this ’70s hairdo…I just love it. There hasn’t been another time so far that people were as expressive and creative and innovative as that time. Now everybody’s [singing] about how big their car is, and how much diamonds they have. And it’s like, “Who cares? What about all those amazing songs that people wrote that have nothing to do with money or fame?”</p><p>It definitely seems like there were more songs about social awareness back then…</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span></p><p><strong>To this day, you still put on those songs and they come on on the radio in the car, and you just feel the difference, you know?</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_20"></span></p><p><strong>So what’s currently in heavy rotation in your music mix?</strong></p><p>Right now, I keep listening to the Libertines record, which is a British band that I’m sort of obsessed with right now. They are such a throwback to London when the Sex Pistols were around. I mean, they are really, truly punk rock. Because I know there’s a lot of bands that try to be, but this guy is. I mean, he is insane. And I’m in love with that record right now. And another band called The Bravery. And what old music do I have in my car right now? Oh, I’ve been listening to Nick Drake a lot…</p><p><strong>Having such a passion for the era, what was it like for you to get to play Anita and be a part of Stoned?</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span></p><p>For me, it’s all the things that I dream about doing as an actor–doing a story that you love, but then getting to play these real people, and getting to do it with a cast of actors that are so talented and a director that’s sort of entrepreneur of film. The [director of photography] does huge movies like Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven…And it was just everybody wanting to work on it so much, we all just went, “Okay, sure, we’ll do it for nothing.” And it was so much fun to go to work every day, from the costumes to the music to the story that we got to tell. And I think that it’s beautiful to look at. The movie’s shot beautifully, and it looks like actual footage from the ’60s.</p><p><strong>How did you all approach the film’s distinctive look?</strong></p><p>Stephen was really specific about the different times and the different people that were in his life [being shot differently]. All of my stuff was very dark and diffused and shaky and grainy. And when he’s at the house in the country with his new girlfriend, Anna, everything’s very surreal and almost fantasy-like. It was definitely intended to be shot that way.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_14"></span></p><p><strong>Is it true that your middle name is Happy?</strong></p><p>[blushingly] Yes!</p><p>Based on your reaction, it sounds like something that haunts you…</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_15"></span></p><p>I hated it when I was a kid! Then it sort of became a novelty because no one ever believed me. I actually went to the DMV once when I was getting my license renewed, and I said, “Could you please put my middle name on my driver’s license?” because no one ever believed me. So I filled out the form and I pushed it over to the woman. She looked at me and she goes [country accent] “You sure you want that on your driver’s license?” [laughs] I was like, “Yes, I do, that’s my name.” And now I hardly use it anymore.</p><p><strong>Has had it on your license ever been useful? Like, have you avoided a ticket because a cop saw your name and it became a conversation piece?</strong></p><p>No. No one’s ever found it amusing at all. [laughs] I’ve never gotten out of a ticket in my life!</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_16"></span></p><p><strong>What projects do you have on the horizon?</strong></p><p>I have a film that I’m going to do at the end of the year called Snuffed, and I’m actually just signed on to do a new TV show.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_24"></span></p><p><strong>What’s that called?</strong></p><p>It doesn’t have a name yet. It’s called the Untitled Carol Mendelsohn Project. She’s the producer and the writer. It’s for CBS, and that is my new job for the moment.</p><p><strong>Comedy or drama?</strong></p><p>It’s a one-hour drama, and I play a lawyer. So it’s quite different than Stoned! [laughs]</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_25"></span></p><p><strong>It’s great you’re tackling a different role, but I have to ask: Do TV producers ever worry that doctors, lawyers, and crime scene investigators are getting too young and too attractive?</strong></p><p>I know it definitely was a concern of theirs. [laughs] They were worried about it looking too glamorous. But you know, that’s my job. I’m an actor, so hopefully, I can transform into that and you’ll believe it.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_26"></span></p><p>Thanks for your time. It was nice to meet you.</p><p>Thank you. Nice to meet you, too.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_27"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=monet-mazur-movies-and-tv-shows></span>Monet Mazur Movies And Tv Shows<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=year-title></span>Year&nbsp; &nbsp; Title<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h4>Movies 2001-2002</h4><p>2009&nbsp; &nbsp;Dead Man Running<br>2008&nbsp; &nbsp;The Last International Playboy<br>2008&nbsp; &nbsp;The House Bunny<br>2007&nbsp; &nbsp;Live!<br>2006&nbsp; &nbsp;Whirlygirl<br>2005&nbsp; &nbsp;Monster-in-Law<br>2005&nbsp; &nbsp;In Memory of My Father<br>2005&nbsp; &nbsp;Stoned<br>2004&nbsp; &nbsp;Torque<br>2003&nbsp; &nbsp;Just Married</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_23"></span></p><h4>Movies 2001-2002</h4><p>2002&nbsp; &nbsp;Sadie’s Daydream<br>2002&nbsp; &nbsp;40 Days and 40 Nights<br>2002&nbsp; &nbsp;Stark Raving Mad<br>2002&nbsp; Comic Book Villains<br>2002&nbsp; &nbsp;Kiss the Bride<br>2001&nbsp; &nbsp;Blow<br>2001&nbsp; &nbsp;Angel Eyes<br>2001&nbsp; &nbsp;The Learning Curve</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_28"></span></p><h4>Movies 1993-1999</h4><p>1999&nbsp; &nbsp;The Mod Squad<br>1999&nbsp; &nbsp;Mystery Men<br>1998&nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome to Hollywood<br>1997&nbsp; &nbsp;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery<br>1995&nbsp; &nbsp;Raging Angels<br>1993&nbsp; &nbsp;Addams Family Values</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=monet-happy-mazur-instagram></span>Monet Happy Mazur Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BwfIFFtACbS/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_29"></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWfo7K1ecyasa6qXZe2sLPRmqehsV2WtKZ5x66qm5memXqnrcyio7JlmJq2qLTTZpiuq6Seu268zrCcq6tdqbyzvdSeZK2glWK5pq3Rp6Cnn12YwrPCxGZpaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
