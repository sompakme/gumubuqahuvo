However, after Georgie dropped out of school and started working in Meemaw's laundromat, Georgie's storyline saw him work hard to mature as both a husband and father.</p><p>Georgie and Mandy's relationship has been a controversial detail for many fans of The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon, due to their age difference and the fact that <strong><a href=#>Big Bang Theory</a></strong> canon tells us <a href=#>their relationship was doomed from the start.</a> Still, creators Steven Molaro and Chuck Lorre saw potential in the newlywed's story, so much so that they chose to go with these Young Sheldon characters for the continuation of the Big Bang Theory universe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the following, we dive into a guide to Georgie and Mandy's relationship timeline and how it leads into Georgie and Mandy's First Marriage.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>3:22</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_young-sheldon-vs-big-bang-theory-the-biggest-plot-holes-explained_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Young Sheldon Vs.

The two instantly connect, with Mandy returning to the laundromat soon after to see Georgie again. After spending the day together at the laundromat, Georgie offers to take Mandy out to dinner while her clothes are drying. But before they go out on their first date, <strong>Georgie and Mandy both lie about their age</strong> - Mandy says she's 25, and Georgie says he's 21. In reality, Georgie is only 17 years old when he meets Mandy, and Mandy is 29 years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=georgie-and-mandy-39-s-first-date>Georgie And Mandy's First Date</h3><p>After both lying about their age, Georgie and Mandy proceed to have dinner at Medford's popular Cantina. Their first date is interrupted by Meemaw, who comes over to their table just as an underaged Georgie is given a margarita by the waitress. Meemaw doesn't call Georgie out in front of his date, though, she just makes things awkward enough for Georgie that he turns down the margarita, with the excuse being he's driving, not that he's underage.</p><p>After dinner, Georgie and Mandy are seen making out in the car. Mandy confesses her true age of 29 to Georgie, which would have been the opportune time for Georgie to come clean about his lie, but he doesn't. Instead, Georgie says, "Well, then, I guess there's something I should tell you... I'm totally fine with that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=georgie-and-mandy-39-s-age-difference>Georgie And Mandy's Age Difference</h3><p><strong>Georgie and Mandy's age difference of 12 years </strong>becomes a big deal once Meemaw learns Mandy is much older than Georgie. After Georgie insists, "Age ain't nothin' but a number," Meemaw replies:</p><p>"Well, her number's way bigger than your number."</p><p>Meemaw pushes Georgie to tell Mandy his real age before they have "too much fun." But he doesn't; instead, he brings her back to the garage at his parent's house and things heat up fast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=georgie-and-mandy-39-s-first-fight>Georgie And Mandy's First Fight</h3><p>In season 5, episode 17, "A Solo Peanut, a Social Butterfly and the Truth," Georgie and Mandy's relationship comes to its first big crossroads. After helping Mandy move in to her studio apartment, the pair once again get intimate. It is shortly after <strong>Mandy learns Georgie's real age.</strong></p><p>She finds out he's dropped out of high school, and asks, "So, what other secrets are you hiding from me? You got a wife and kids?" He replies, "No, but I'm not really 21. I'm 17." Mandy instantly freaks out and kicks Georgie out despite his attempts to smooth things over.</p><h2 id=when-mandy-finds-out-she-39-s-pregnant-with-georgie-39-s-baby-on-young-sheldon>When Mandy Finds Out She's Pregnant With Georgie's Baby On Young Sheldon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mandy-and-georgie-young-sheldon-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the beginning of Georgie and Mandy's relationship, <strong>Mandy had no idea Georgie was only 17, while she was 29 years old</strong>. Unfortunately, once Georgie finally tells her the truth, it is too late. At the end of Young Sheldon season 5, episode 17, Georgie visits Mandy to try to apologize for lying about his age. <strong>She then reveals she is pregnant.</strong></p><p>During season 5, episode 18, "Babies, Lies and a Resplendent Cannoli," Georgie and Mandy deal with the aftermath of Mandy finding out she's pregnant, including Georgie asking her if she was sure the baby was his - which she did not like at all.</p><p>After finally accepting the news of Mandy's pregnancy, <strong>Georgie is convinced he needs to do the "right thing" and marry her.</strong></p><p>In season 5, episode 19, "A God-Fearin' Baptist and a Hot Trophy Husband," Georgie's parents, George and Mary Cooper, find out about Mandy's pregnancy. Their reaction to the news was only made worse by finding out Mandy is 29 years old.

Things don't start off very smoothly and <strong>take an even more awkward turn when Mary brings religion into the discussion,</strong> asking Mandy about her religious preference and if the baby will be raised with religion.</p><p>Mary ensures Mandy that "regardless of what goes on with her parents," they will be there for her and the baby who they will love and cherish. Georgie offers to go with Mandy when she tells her parents.<strong> Mary suggests Mandy and Georgie get married,</strong> to which Mandy is not thrilled about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm having a baby, I don't need to marry another one."</p><p>Trying to comfort her, Georgie states, "I know I'm young now, but think about, when you're a dried-up old lady, I'll be your hot trophy husband."</p><p>Mary further pushes the issue of marriage on Mandy and Georgie, which leads to an argument between George and Mary at the dinner table in front of Mandy. George is strongly against Georgie marrying Mandy only because he got her pregnant, because when George and Mary were Georgie's age, they too got pregnant and decided to get married, and it didn't turn out great for them, as their marriage was seriously struggling during season 5 of Young Sheldon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the dinner, Mandy finds some solace in Meemaw's offer of help and the comfort of knowing what it's like to go through this same kind of situation.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:10</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_young-sheldon-photos-of-the-cast-then-vs-now_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Young Sheldon: Photos Of The Cast Then Vs.

He tells her he'll go to the baby classes with her and do anything she needs. Mandy's annoyance is obvious, but Georgie does not give up.
