Although <strong>Tisdale has been married to Christopher French </strong>since 2014, the star had been in a romantic relationship with <strong>musician, songwriter, and record producer Martin Johnson</strong>. Reports of <strong>Tisdale dating the former Boys Like Girls front-man</strong> began in early January 2012. As published by The Huffington Post, Tisdale and Johnson were spotted by the press and photographers leaving LAX in Los Angeles.
