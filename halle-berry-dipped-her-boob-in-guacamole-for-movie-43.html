On Wednesday, Jan. 23, the Dumb and Dumber director participated in an "Ask Me Anything" session on <a href=#>Reddit</a>, during which he was asked which actor surprised him most on set.</p><p>"I would have to say Halle Berry…I was a little nervous about meeting her because her scene is so outrageous, and I was afraid she might get on the set and balk," Farrelly explained of the Oscar winner, 46, mom to daughter <strong>Nahla</strong>, 4. "Not only did she not, but she thought the scene was too soft and asked us to amp it up a little."</p><p>A little turned into a lot. "We ended up coming up with a couple of things for her to do that weren't scripted but were insane," Farrelly said. "To give you an example, [her scene] is about a couple (her and <strong>Stephen Merchant</strong>) who play Truth or Dare on a first date. Among other things, she ended up sticking her bare breast into a bowl of guacamole. She couldn't have been more fun to work with."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>However, sources told <a href=#>E! News</a> — and Berry's rep confirmed — that the breasts you see in the film are prosthetics. "They're so huge," one insider said. "You can totally tell they're fake."</p><p>Movie 43, which is being billed as "The Biggest Cast Ever Assembled For the Most Outrageous Comedy Ever Made," is a series of interrelated shorts shot by Farrelly and 11 other directors. Among its star-studded ensemble? <strong>Kate Winslet</strong>, <strong>Hugh Jackman</strong>, <strong>Emma Stone</strong>, <strong>Anna Faris</strong>, <strong>Naomi Watts</strong>, <strong>Gerard Butler</strong>, <strong>Richard Gere</strong>, <strong>Uma Thurman</strong>, and <strong>Liev Schreiber</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ%2BapJyaeqOx0auwZpyZpb2msIyhnKtlkqS8o3nIp2SgrZGYrq67y55kn6eiYrqwwsieZG1rXWd9cn%2BRbWho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
