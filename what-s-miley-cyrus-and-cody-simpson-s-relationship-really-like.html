As a result, both Miley and Cody have come from public and famous break-ups, before settling down with each other.</p><p>In this article, we take a look at Miley and Cody's relationship and what the couple is like.</p><h2 id=they-do-many-activities-together><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>They&nbsp;Do Many Activities Together</span></h2><p>Ever since Miley and Cody have come out together publicly as a couple, they have been photographed numerous times enjoying various activities together. Anything from a date night in a vegan fast food, to hikes and walks with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dogs</a>, the two love birds keep each other company doing nothing and anything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">12 Things Fans Ignore About Gwen Stefani And Blake Shelton's Relationship (And 8 Great Things)</a></span></p><h2 id=they-re-best-friends><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>They're Best Friends</span></h2><p>Miley has often labeled her partner as being her best friend on her social media. Cody has also called Miley his "best friend". Their complicity is undeniable. They really are close, and by the looks of most paparazzi shots taken of the pair, there is no arguing with that fact.</p><h2 id=miley-and-cody-love-spending-time-together-doing-nothing-and-anything><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Miley And Cody Love Spending Time Together Doing Nothing And Anything</span></h2><p>That's right, although the couple can often be spotted being active together, they are also photographed not doing anything in particular. This is a great sign, as it means they are comfortable with each other enough to not force themselves into doing anything. The couple often shares on social media their nights in cuddling and watching TV.</p><h2 id=they-are-not-afraid-of-some-pda><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They Are Not Afraid Of Some PDA</span></h2><p>We have seen Miley being photographed enjoying some nights out flirting and such. However, this can't be said about the Australian musician, who happens to have been more private about his life. Nevertheless, ever since Cody has been with the Tennessee-born singer, he hasn't been afraid to put his love to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">display</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-are-using-their-creativity-together><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Are Using Their Creativity Together</span></h2><p>Last April, Cody published a book of poetry entitled Prince Neptune. But living with another artist has enabled the Australian singer to make even more art than anticipated. Indeed, alongside his book, Cody released a new song entitled Captain's Dance With the Devil. As a result, he brought no other but Miley to direct his music video.</p><h2 id=miley-and-cody-share-a-mutual-love-for-pets><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Miley And Cody Share A Mutual Love For Pets</span></h2><p>Animal lovers will most likely bond the best with other animal lovers. Luckily for Miley, who has always been known to have many dogs and pets in her life, Cody also loves animals. Last March, the lovebirds adopted a rescue little dog together, making their relationship just the more serious.</p><h2 id=they-share-the-same-humour><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>They Share The Same Humour</span></h2><p>The 27-year-old American singer has finally found a partner with whom she can be playful and have fun with. Last October, the couple spent their first Halloween together dressed as Billy Idol and Perri Lister and proceeded to take many amusing photos together. They have also taken over Tik Tok to make ridiculous dances together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Secret To A Happy Marriage, According To These Celebrity Couples</a></span></p><h2 id=although-they-are-open-to-the-idea-they-aren-t-ready-for-marriage-yet><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Although They Are Open To The Idea, They Aren't Ready For Marriage Yet</span></h2><p>The pair won't be planning a wedding anytime soon. Which is probably a wise decision considering how fresh Miley's divorce is. However, getting married isn't an absurd vision for the couple. Cody has revealed in an interview that he believed in marriage, and Miley isn't opposed to the idea in the future.</p><h2 id=they-ve-always-been-secretly-attracted-to-each-other><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They've Always Been Secretly Attracted To Each Other</span></h2><p>Miley and Cody have known each other, as well as been friends for years. But for the Australian musician, being with the Tennessee-born singer is almost a childhood dream come true. That's right, Cody recently revealed that he had been crushing on Miley since the age of 9. While in 2015, Miley revealed that she thought Cody was an&nbsp;"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">epic guitar player</a>".</p><h2 id=miley-and-cody-have-the-same-passion-for-music><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Miley And Cody Have The Same Passion For Music</span></h2><p>The artistic couple shares a very obvious passion: music! Cody has been recording and playing music ever since he was 12 years old, before releasing his debut single in 2010, when he was only 13. While Miley, as we know, has been immersed in the music industry ever since she was born.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-share-the-same-life-values><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Share The Same Life Values</span></h2><p>Being such a steady couple can be explained by not only their close friendship and bond, but also by their similar life values. Miley and Cody are both philanthropists who advocate protecting the environment and more. As a matter of fact, the couple has most recently distributed free meals for health workers.</p><h2 id=they-aren-t-afraid-of-voicing-their-love-for-each-other><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They Aren't Afraid Of Voicing Their Love For Each Other</span></h2><p>In addition to doing the occasional PDA, Miley and Cody have also made the choice to voice their love for each other on numerous occasions. The cute and artistic pair have often written loving things about each other on social media, as well as complimenting one another in interviews.</p><h2 id=they-have-been-loving-spending-time-together-during-lockdown><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Have Been Loving Spending Time Together During Lockdown</span></h2><p>As we have mentioned above, the two lovebirds, who happen to also be best friends, love spending time doing activities together. During the Covid-19 pandemic, this hasn't changed, and they have been enjoying doing things together just as much during the lockdown, as before. One could even argue that quarantining has brought the couple closer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Priyanka Chopra And Nick Jonas, Quarantine Couple Goals</a></span></p><h2 id=miley-and-cody-have-often-snapped-back-at-break-up-rumours><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Miley And Cody Have Often Snapped Back At Break Up Rumours</span></h2><p>Celebrity couple breakups always make for popular headlines in the tabloids. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that Miley and Cody's relationship has been brought in a bad light in the media. However, this hasn't phased the couple in the slightest, and they have clapped back at breakup rumors on more than one occasion.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus Maybe Having A Great Time With Cody Simpson But She Is Clearly Homesick</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkqHqutcuesGabqafCtHnAp5tmm5%2BZxm6%2FyKanrKeeqHqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMq5yapJyueq21yp5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
