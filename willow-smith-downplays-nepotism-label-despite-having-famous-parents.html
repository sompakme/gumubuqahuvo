The 23-year-old eclectic artist shared with the pub that she actually doesn’t consider herself a “nepo baby,” despite having famous parents Will and Jada Pinkett Smith.
Speaking of how she deals with outside noise critiquing her trajectory to fame, Willow admitted that the term, which is given to famous children because of their lineage, doesn’t fit her case."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That has driven me to work really hard to try to prove them wrong. But nowadays, I don’t need to prove sh*t to anybody.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Despite having celebrity privilege, the “Meet Me At Our Spot” crooner acknowledged that her skin color overrides everything.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Being Black in America, even with privilege, which I’m never going to deny that I have, you’re still Black,” she continued. “I love being Black. People would look at me and [say], ‘Okay, well, her parents are this and that, but she still is like me. She still has brown skin.’ And we all know that that doesn’t exempt you from anything, and that’s a place of connection.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Willow’s cousin Jade also spoke on her idea of nepotism in a recent sit-down with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Essence Girls United.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“In terms of nepotism, I feel that term doesn’t even apply to me,” <a href=# rel=nofollow>she told the outlet</a>. “Growing up, my life was a lot different, especially for me and my siblings. I always had to put the work in, creating late hours [and] nothing was ever given to me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She added, “My family always made it clear that if you want something, you have to go and get it. You have to put in the work and show people that you’re worthy, that this is what you want to do, and be great at it so that nobody denies you. And that was the advice that my auntie Jada had always told me growing up.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Check out Willow Smith’s sentiments on Nepotism above and read her entire cover with Allure <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6y2rbjOsGSspZmptW6%2FwLKqZqaVpby1tdKmZJ2nlai7tXnAqaelsV2eu7Wx0a%2Bgnq9dZn90gJdwbG5qZGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
