Based on the novel by Liane Moriarty, Big Little Lies follows a group of women whose lives seem perfect on the surface.&nbsp;It's only once you dig a&nbsp;little deeper that things get dark—and fast.</p><p>Big Little Lies&nbsp;started off as a miniseries, but its popularity warranted HBO to renew it for a second season. This is due, in part, to the all-star cast HBO hired to bring the world Moriarty created to the big screen. Hollywood royalty, Meryl Streep joined Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley, and Zoe Kravitz for the show's second season.</p><p>We don't know how much money HBO is shelling out to keep these A-listers happy, but we do have an idea of the big bucks the cast has already accumulated.
