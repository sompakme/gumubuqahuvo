This decade was arguably one of the best when it came to film culture, and movie buffs were rewarded with cult horrors, teenage dramas, and Jennifer Love Hewitt. The star has maintained her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stunning image with several transformations over the years</a>, including quite the glow-up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was&nbsp;also&nbsp;a household name by the time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she had starred in</a>&nbsp;I Know What You Did Last Summer&nbsp;and continued to gain popularity with her musical talents and overall flawless appearance. It was because of this that she gained attention where her love life was concerned, too, and&nbsp;this star's dating history hasn't been too shabby.</p><h2 id=back-in-2001-she-dated-the-famous-enrique-iglesias><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Back In 2001, She Dated The Famous Enrique Iglesias</span></h2><p>It's not hard to fall for&nbsp;someone who sings about true love, romance, and passion with every other song lyric, and that's exactly what Hewitt did. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her career began in 1995 and is still active today</a>, but after working together in the music video for "Hero" back in 2001, the two struck up a romance that had fans singing, "Bailamos" for sure.</p><h2 id=she-even-premiered-in-one-of-his-music-videos-back-when-they-were-all-the-rage><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>She Even Premiered In One Of His Music Videos, Back When They Were All The Rage</span></h2><p>Very few people would say "no" in response to the chance of having Hewitt premiere in a music video (or any video, really) and Enrique Iglesias is no different. While the song "Hero" was an almost instant success, it was the steamy video and budding attraction that went along with it that really caught everyone's attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=for-years-she-ranked-as-one-of-the-most-attractive-women-in-the-world><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>For Years She Ranked As One Of The Most Attractive Women In The World</span></h2><p>It's an honor that Hewitt carried during the years 2002, 2005, 2006, and again in 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014. That's over a decade of being considered one of the most attractive women in the world, most of which was decided according to&nbsp;Maxim, which had her on the&nbsp;Hot 100&nbsp;multiple times.</p><h2 id=she-married-her-co-star-brian-hallisay-after-only-one-year><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Married Her Co-Star, Brian Hallisay, After Only One Year</span></h2><p>It's the relationship the star is still in, to this day, and also one of the quickest-moving. After only one year of dating her co-star from&nbsp;The Client List, Brian&nbsp;Hallisay, the two were married in 2013. Now, they have one daughter, Autumn James, and one son, Atticus James, together.</p><h2 id=as-a-young-star-she-had-a-short-relationship-with-joey-lawrence-while-on-party-of-five><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>As A Young Star, She Had A Short Relationship With Joey Lawrence While On Party of Five</span></h2><p>Way back when, many people remember a young Joey Lawrence. While many of his TV and movie appearances are remembered with Melissa Joan-Hart (including his most recent), there was a short period of time when he had a role with Hewitt, and, of course, a relationship was the end result.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-romance-with-carson-daly-lasted-roughly-two-years-in-the-late-90s><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Her Romance With Carson Daly Lasted Roughly Two Years In The Late 90s</span></h2><p>Another notable relationship was with none other than Carson Daly, the heartthrob of many a teenage girl. While their relationship only lasted roughly two years, the two were seen together plenty, and there's no denying they made quite the handsome couple.</p><h2 id=the-actress-and-singer-doesn-t-shy-away-from-talking-about-love-in-her-four-albums><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Actress (And Singer!) Doesn't Shy Away From Talking About Love In Her Four Albums</span></h2><p>Obviously, love is a popular topic when it comes to both singing and songwriting. It can come from a place of divine happiness or a place of utter heartache, and Hewitt has written about both. While she's known more so for her acting career rather than her singing career, her four albums, personal and intimate, are well-loved by fans.</p><h2 id=in-2002-hewitt-dated-john-meyer-for-a-short-time><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>In 2002, Hewitt Dated John Meyer For A Short Time</span></h2><p>Speaking of singing, Hewitt also dated singer John Mayer, someone who has had plenty of songs about love and heartache, himself. Although the only thing he was singing after their relationship abruptly ended would have been about the latter, considering it was an "oops" moment on his part that led to their previously well-kept secret.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-it-ended-when-he-accidentally-revealed-their-relationship-unintentionally><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>But It Ended When He Accidentally Revealed Their Relationship Unintentionally</span></h2><p>During one of his comedy routines (fun fact: Mayer is a funny guy), the singer accidentally let it slip that he and Hewitt were dating. It was information that wasn't meant to go public, not at that moment, anyway, and their short relationship ended shortly after it was revealed in 2002. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He apologized for it, though!</a></p><h2 id=she-was-offered-the-chance-to-pose-in-playboy-but-turned-it-down><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Was Offered The Chance To Pose In Playboy, But Turned It Down</span></h2><p>Hewitt is pretty well known for having a big heart and supporting causes that are important to her, and it turns out that&nbsp;Playboy&nbsp;wasn't one of them. While she was voted one of the most attractive women in the world for years consecutively, she chose to maintain her privacy and turned down the offer to model for the magazine.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising Facts About Dakota Johnson's Love Life</a></span></p><h2 id=she-was-engaged-to-another-co-star-ross-mccall-after-their-time-on-the-ghost-whisperer><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She Was Engaged To Another Co-Star, Ross McCall, After Their Time On The Ghost Whisperer</span></h2><p>While Hallisay wasn't the only actor (or co-star) Hewitt was engaged to, he's the only one she truly had eyes for, as it turns out. The actress was engaged for a short time to actor Ross McCall during their time together on&nbsp;The Ghost Whisperer, and the whole thing lasted less than three years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">After Bruce Willis: Everything We Know About Demi Moore's Love Life</a></span></p><h2 id=and-she-also-dated-another-co-star-from-the-same-show-jamie-kennedy-but-not-for-long><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>And She Also Dated Another Co-Star From The Same Show, Jamie Kennedy, But Not For Long</span></h2><p>Jamie Kennedy was another actor who was drawn to Hewitt and vice versa, but their relationship lasted even less than most mentioned. From March of 2009 to March of the following year, the two were exclusive, but despite being adorable together, nothing lasted past the one-year mark.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Love Hewit & Carson Daly And 19 Other Celeb Parents We Forgot Dated</a></span></p><h2 id=in-2010-she-had-a-short-lived-relationship-with-fellow-actor-alex-beh><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>In 2010, She Had A Short-Lived Relationship With Fellow Actor Alex Beh</span></h2><p>After her relationship with Kennedy, Hewitt found herself in an even shorter relationship with actor and director Alex Beh. Known most well in the independent film business, Beh dated Hewitt briefly in 2010 before the two broke it off, and afterward, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hewitt confirmed that she is a "hopeless romantic".</a></p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Photos Of Jennifer Love Hewitt's Famous Exes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrqqgp7a0tc2gZJ%2BZk6nAbrbEp6WinpWneq271Z5koZ2nnsG1v4ylpq%2BdXaG2p7GMm6aynqKesq%2Bw0mapnqSRqbawutKhoKmrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
