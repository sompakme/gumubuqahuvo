TMZ caught up with the 50-year-old Baby Driver actor as he was leaving the NBA All-Star basketball tournament “Chacha The Wave” party on Saturday, February 17, in Thousand Oaks, California.
He quickly stopped to talk to a photographer and when the photog told him to “do your thing,” he responded: “It’s Black History Month."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After ESPN’s <strong>Michael Smith</strong> asked him about his Valentine’s Day basketball date with his 39-year-old girlfriend, Foxx simply smirked, took off his headset and walked away from the camera.</p><p>As previously reported, the musician and the Dawson’s Creek alum — who have played coy about their five year relationship — <a href=#>spent the holiday at a basketball court</a> in Calabasas on Wednesday, February 14.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They were really happy,” an eyewitness told Us Weekly of their date. “Katie was dancing as they walked in and Jamie was laughing. They seem really at ease and truly enjoying each other.”</p><p>Us Weekly broke the news in 2013 that Foxx and Holmes were dating. The couple — who have never confirmed their relationship — were not spotted together in public until September 2017 when they were seen holding hands on a beach in Malibu.</p><p>Prior to her relationship with Foxx, Holmes was married to <strong>Tom Cruise</strong> from 2006 to 2012 and the two share an 11-year-old daughter Suri. Foxx, however, has never been married, but has two daughters, Corinne, 23, and Annalise, 7, from previous relationships.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ2esm6yzrGvZqyVlsCmv4ynpmavmJ7BpnnGoqmlq12nwq2xjJ%2Bmq2WSoa6kt4yhoKysn6fGbrnOp6uhZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
