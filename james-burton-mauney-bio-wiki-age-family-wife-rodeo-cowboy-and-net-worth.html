He is also one of only five riders to get a qualified ride on Asteroid which he accomplished on the BFTS in San Antonio, Texas, in August 2012, for a score of 93.50 points. Asteroid, the 2012 World Champion bull, earned a high score of 46.25 points.</p><p>Mauney competed for the first several years of his professional career with a helmet. However, by 2013, he was riding with a cowboy hat. On November 5, 2016, Mauney made PBR history by being the first bull rider to reach the $7 million mark in career earnings. In 2017, Mauney suffered a significant injury to his right arm, requiring surgery to install a screw and 13 anchors. Mauney’s career has been plagued with many injuries, but he has continued to pursue professional bull riding history.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=2019-present></span>2019-Present<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“It’s part of being a cowboy”, he stated in an interview with Monster Energy”, when you crawl into a chute, nothing else matters. You tie your hand and you don’t give up until you hit the dirt”. In 2019 Mauney tied another two-time world champion Justin McBride for the most televised wins within the 26-year history of the PBR. In an interview for the PBR, Mauney said “What gets me is when people who don’t ride bulls for a living try to tell me when it’s time to hang it up”.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span></p><p>Mauney has won the PBR World Championship title two times, in 2013 and 2015. He has also won the PBR World Finals event two times, in 2009 and 2013. In his first year of competition, he won the Rookie of the Year in 2006. He qualified for the PBR World Finals 15 times in his career (2006-2020).</p><p>Since 2020, Mauney has been part owner of Ultimate Bullfighters (UBF), an American freestyle bullfighting organization. After struggling to find success during the first few events of the 2021 PBR season, Mauney decided to try his luck in the PRCA. In July of that year, Mauney announced that he would step away from riding in the PBR to focus solely on riding in the PRCA and qualifying for his first-ever National Finals Rodeo.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><h1><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions_About_Amanda_Anka><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions_About_XYZ_H2_and_Centered>Frequently Asked Questions About James Burton Mauney</span></span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-mauney></span><span id=Who_is_Amanda_Anka><span id=Who_is_XYZAll_NamesAll_questions_in_H2>Who is Mauney?</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>James Burton Mauney is an American professional rodeo cowboy.
