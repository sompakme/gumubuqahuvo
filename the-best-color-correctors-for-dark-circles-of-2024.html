They’re designed to be used under </span><a href=#><span>concealer</span></a><span> to neutralize the uneven and discolored tones in your skin, making them the perfect tool for covering up those pesky </span><a href=#><span>dark circles</span></a><span> and undereye redness.</span></p><p><span>These days, </span><a href=#><span>color correctors</span></a><span> come in a variety of colors. Some are better suited for those who want to subtly conceal redness or dark circles, while others are designed to cover up deeper discoloration. However, with the many color correctors on the market, it can be hard to know which is right for you. In this guide, we’ve discussed all the important factors in picking the best color corrector for dark circles.</span></p><h2 class=section-title>Formula</h2><p><span>The formula for the color corrector varies from brand to brand. Ideally, you want to select a color corrector based on its suitability for your skin type, sensitivity, and any potential allergies. Look for a </span><a href=#><span>non-comedogenic formula</span></a><span> free of harsh chemicals or fragrances that may cause irritation or dryness. Opt for a product that contains natural ingredients like Vitamin C, jojoba oil, and green tea extract, as they can help fight free radicals, reduce inflammation, and add hydration to the skin.</span></p><h2 class=section-title>Coverage</h2><p><span>After you’ve determined what kind of color corrector you want, you’ll need to consider the coverage level you’d like to achieve. If you have deep dark circles or under-eye blemishes, select a product that provides full coverage and helps minimize dark circles without settling into fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes.</span></p><h2 class=section-title>Shade Matching</h2><p><span>Before buying, make sure the brand you choose offers a wide range of shades that are the right colors of color corrector. It can take a few tries to get it right, especially if you’re shopping online and not able to swatch in the store! If you’re not sure about which shade is right for you, try visiting a beauty counter to get advice from an expert or look at online swatches.</span></p><h2 class=section-title>Texture</h2><p><span>Regarding texture, there are two main types of color correctors: creamy and powdery. Creamy products are typically easier to blend than powdery ones because they don’t settle into pores. However, they tend to crease more easily and do not last as long on oily skin types because they’re not mattifying enough.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, powders have a tendency to be more pigmented than creams. Still, they can sometimes be too drying when worn under makeup, especially if you have dry or sensitive skin types or tend to use many different products on top of each other every day.</span></p><p><span>Your color corrector should have a creamy and lightweight formula that is easy to blend and won’t cake up or flake off during wear. Also, look for products with oil-free bases that don’t contain silicones. They may cause smudging as they can be difficult to blend.</span></p><h2 class=section-title>What do the different color corrector colors mean?</h2><p><a href=#><span>Complementary or opposite colors</span></a><span> neutralize each other; this is because of something called </span><a href=#><span>hue cancellation</span></a><span>. Because dark circles typically have purple or blue undertones, you’ll want to choose an orange, peach, or yellow color corrector. Orange cancels out blue, yellow cancels out purple, and peach cancels out indigo.&nbsp; If your dark circles have redness, a green color corrector would work best (because red cancels green). I know you weren’t expecting a mini art lesson, but here we are!</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6eyt7XEsKpompWowW6vzqWmq2WTpL%2BzscKtpqtllqS%2FbrDAq6Jmm5mnsK2x0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
