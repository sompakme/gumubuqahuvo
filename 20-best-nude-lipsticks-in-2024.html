Depending on your skin tone this will vary. This guide breaks down everything from price, finish, ingredients to application to help you make an informed decision and make sure you get the perfect lipstick.</p><h2 class=section-title>What to Consider When Choosing the Best Nude Lipstick</h2><h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3><p>Lipstick has come a long way since it was first invented centuries ago. Wearing lipstick everyday can sometimes be quite drying for lips, leading to that cracked look. When shopping for a new lip color keep an eye out for one that includes skin enriching ingredients such as vitamin E, shea or mango butter and any type of antioxidant.</p><p>Squalane and hyaluronic acid can also help to plump so any lipstick containing these two will help with the overall appearance of lips</p><h3><strong>Brand</strong></h3><p>Every makeup brand has a lipstick collection, so you are definitely spoiled for choice when making a selection. This can also be slightly overwhelming, which is why we curated this list carefully to include an option for every skin tone and finish.</p><p>Revlon, Rimmel and Maybelline provide great drugstore options, while Charlotte Tilbury and La Bouge Rouge have luxury offerings if you want to treat yourself or looking to gift someone something special.</p><h3><strong>Finish</strong></h3><p>Lipstick and lip color finish can generally be put into five categories. Matte, Satin, Gloss, Shimmer and Sheer. Which you go for is completely up to you. Matte is great for a clean classic makeup look while gloss works well if you're wearing a heavier eye look.</p><p>Satin lipstick always looks elegant and can be slightly less drying than matte. Shimmer and sheer finishes always work for a more dewy makeup vibe.</p><h3><strong>Price</strong></h3><p>Investing in a good lipstick is something you will never regret and when you find your perfect shade you will most likely go on to re-purchase it again and again throughout your lifetime. If you do wear lipstick everyday it can be worth having one for special occasions and then using a more affordable drugstore option for daily use.</p><p>Read over our Budget and Drugstore picks as they provide high quality color for great prices and then our Splurge choice for when you want to invest in a little more luxury.</p><h3><strong>Application</strong></h3><p>Nude lipstick can be worn with or without lip liner. If you have the time, powder the outside of the lips to avoid lipstick bleeding throughout the day, then outline your lips and fill them in with your chosen lipstick. You can do this directly with the product or by using a lip brush for more precision.</p><p>Glosses and shimmer are super handy when you are in a rush or short on time as they can be applied using their wand for instant color.</p><h2 class=section-title>What are the Different Types of Nude Lipstick?</h2><h3><strong>Matte</strong></h3><p>The original and for most people the most flattening finish, a matte lipstick provides solid color that enhances the lip shade and suits almost everybody. Best teamed with a lip liner to create a cupid's bow, once you find your perfect nude matte shade you will stay with it for life.</p><h3><strong>Satin</strong></h3><p>Satin finish lipsticks provide the same impact of color as matte but with a slightly softer look. This is a great alternative for those who want to create a classic day makeup with a more natural feel. Satin lipsticks also feel extremely comfortable on the lips as they are more lightweight and glide on easily.</p><h3><strong>Glossy</strong></h3><p>Glossy finish nude lipsticks are for the girl on the go who wants a quick and easy makeup application that can be applied anywhere. Glossy finish lip colors also complement heavy eye makeup extremely well and prevent the look from being too overdone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6eyt7XEsKpompWowW661J2cZqSZpcC1tcKkqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
