At the time, I was working with Adidas and we were toying with the idea of a name being a play off of my son’s name.”</p><p>While the Canadian star went on to post pictures of<a href=#> his son’s art</a> and Father’s Day <a href=# data-gift=1>gifts</a>, he didn’t share <a href=#>a photo of Adonis’ face</a> until March.</p><p>“I love and miss my beautiful family and friends and I can’t wait for the joyful day when we are all able to reunite,” Drake captioned an Instagram slideshow amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drake-and-Sophie-Brussaux-Son-Adonis-Yoga-With-Mom-Sophie-Brussaux.jpg><p>The “God’s Plan” rapper continued to document Adonis’ life via social media, from <a href=#>his first day of school</a> in September to<a href=#> his birthday bash</a> the following month.</p><p>“Young Stunna,” Drake captioned party pics. As for Brussaux, she wrote, “Three years ago, I was finally meeting you for the first time, after a long 24-hour labor. I’m so proud of the little man you’re becoming, I love you more than life. The world is YOURS! We did that @champagnepapi.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGadqpGgsrR50qilZpmUpLuqv4ydpp6rXa68qK2MsKCtoF2ivK550qinoaGVYq%2BzwdKsmK6wXau2pbHOaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
