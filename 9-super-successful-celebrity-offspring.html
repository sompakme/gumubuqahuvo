They made sure to step out of their parents' shadows and create a name for themselves. And they have some pretty impressive <a href=#>careers</a> to show for it.</p><h2 id=kate-hudson>KATE HUDSON</h2><p>Kate Hudson's mother, Goldie Hawn, is considered <a href=#>Hollywood royalty</a>. Kate broke out as an actress herself in Almost Famous and even earned herself a Best Supporting Actress Oscar Nomination for the film. Ever since, she has stolen our hearts over and over again in romantic comedy after romantic comedy and, most recently, was nominated for a Golden Globe for Sia's film Music. Not only does she have tons of screen credits under her belt, but she is also the co-founder of the popular athleisure brand Fabletics and is the founder&nbsp; of craft booze company King St. Vodka. She also just launched INBLOOM, a line of beauty supplement powders, hosts a popular podcast with her brother Oliver Hudson and is a brand ambassador for WW (formerly known as Weight Watchers). All that certainly helps contribute to her estimated <a href=#>net worth</a> of $80 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-richie>NICOLE RICHIE</h2><p>We first became familiar with Nicole Richie, daughter of music legend Lionel Richie, through the r<a href=#>eality television</a> series The Simple Life, where she was known as Paris Hilton's childhood friend and fellow socialite. But she quickly broke out of Paris' shadow and carved out a solo career. Following The Simple Life, she continued working in television: she was a judge on the reality competition series Fashion Star, starred in the unscripted comedy series Candidly Nicole, was a series regular on the NBC sitcom Great News and was a judge on the reality competition series Making the Cut. She also founded a lifestyle brand, House of Harlow, for which she won "<a href=#>Entrepreneur</a> of the Year" at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards in 2010. <a href=#>Business Insider</a> had previously estimated that the company was worth $2 million in 2012. Additionally, she has published two novels and had her own semi-self-titled show on Quibi, Nikki Fre$h, which featured her <a href=#>hip-hop</a> persona of the same name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><a href=#>RELATED: 10 Celebrity Kids Who Are Going To Outshine Their Parents (And 10 Who Already Have)</a></span></p><h2 id=margaret-qualley>MARGARET QUALLEY</h2><p>She's a former ballerina and model turned actress AND she's the daughter of actress Andie MacDowell and model and musician Paul Qualley. Although Margaret has been appearing in movies since 2013, her 2019 role as actress and dancer Ann Reinking in the FX miniseries Fosse/Verdon is what really garnered audience attention. She received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie as well as a Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Movie/Miniseries for the role. She then went on to appear in Quentin Tarantino's <a href=#>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood </a>and has had a busy filming schedule ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jaden-smith>JADEN SMITH</h2><p>With not just one famous parent, but two (Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith), Jaden, although only twenty-two, is a multi-hyphenate.
