It’s truly an iconic ring!</p><p>The auction will be live from May 27th to May 31st but may be extended if there’s a lot of interest in the piece.</p><p>The bidding will start at $51,000. But Shanna said she hopes to get at least $120,000 for the solitaire stone, noting that it’s worth $160,000. <a href=#>Worthy.com</a> is hosting the auction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis and Kourtney legally married earlier this month during a courthouse ceremony in California. But it was a necessary step for their celebration with family and friends, which happened last weekend in Portofino, Italy.</p><p>The couple were spotted with their children <a href=#>aboard a $60 million yacht</a> formerly owned by Dolce & Gabbana days before the wedding ceremony. Travis shares two children – Landon, 18, and Alabama, 16 – with Shanna. Kourtney has three kids -- Mason, 12, Penelope, 9, and Reign, 7.</p><p>The gothic-inspired ceremony and reception were later help at Castello Brown, a historic castle on the water. Kourtney <a href=#>wore a white Dolce & Gabana minidress</a> for the occasion, valued at $1,900.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Shanna says she’s moving on from her ex-husband, the reality star previously had trouble adjusting to his relationship with Kourtney. She’s publicly stated she worries the couple’s relationship could be affecting her relationship with her kids.</p><p>However, Shanna then responded to backlash online to deny being “obsessed” with the couple.</p><p>“<a href=#>I’m in a relationship and I’m really happy</a>, and it’s just not something that’s centered in my world,” she stated in February. I wanted America to see me for who I was, and not necessarily what’s pumped out to the masses and the media sometimes.”</p><p>Shanna is currently in a relationship with Matthew Rondeau.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Snoop Dogg Had Good Reason To Reject $2 Million Offer From Michael Jordan</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, <a href=#>ET</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OrmK%2Bho2Kvor7KnqmsZZWteri1xZ5kmq2TqbawutJmnKefkZyyrrHNrWSroZ6cerO1xqGrZpmWqbKzeceeZLCdlKh6rLvUq6unnalk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
