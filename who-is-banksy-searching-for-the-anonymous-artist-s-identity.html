His work is recognized by art lovers across the globe, and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> his pieces of art are sold for astronomical prices. </a>The intrigue surrounding Banksy's identity is a huge factor in the valuation of his work. By all accounts, that makes it far less likely now than ever before, for him to reveal his true identity. There are many rumors surrounding who the real Banksy really is, but there are no actual confirmed reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">identify the artist.</a> In actuality, it's already a significant assumption to state that Banksy is a male. The person responsible for incredible works of street art and pieces of tangible art is truly a mystery. There is no identifying feature or actual name or face that can be attached to any of the art that bears the Banksy name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-early-days>The Early Days</h2><p>One day, in the 1990s, pray painted tags and murals began to appear throughout regions of the United Kingdom. Then there were more. That was soon followed by a mural. Paris, New York, and Bethlehem were soon graced with the same pieces of crafty art on their streets. Before long, the artist shrouded in mystery became known as Banksy, and the socially and politically works of art that were being created were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seeing huge fame.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The National News</a>, there have been a few confirmations that have been made - one of which being the fact that Banksy is from a 'relatively small city in Southern England. He watched a street artist by the name of 3D engage in spray painting&nbsp; and his passion stemmed into creativity from that point forward. He was also said to have begun tapping in to his talents during his school days, making him someone who started to hone on on his talents at a very young age.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Banksy Loses Trademarks To Two More Of His Iconic Works</a></span></p><h2 id=could-robin-gunningham-be-banksy>Could Robin Gunningham Be Banksy?</h2><p>Many believe that the ever-elusive Banksy could actually be a man called Robin Gunningham, who was known to be a talented illustrator during his school years. He was once photographed with a spray can and stencil in his hand, and these parallels were enough to make fans chase down the idea that this could be the man behind the alias name of Banksy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-about-jamie-hewlett>What About Jamie Hewlett?</h2><p>If the Gunningham prediction wasn't fitting, perhaps the story of Banksy's real identity being that of Jamie Hewlett will be the one to believe.&nbsp;The National News has&nbsp;revealed&nbsp;a variety of claims that indicate that Gorillaz founder Jamie Hewlett could actually be the real man behind this famous artwork; "after an anonymous forensic expert claimed paperwork reportedly showed him to be linked to every company Banksy is connected with. The artist has also produced work used in the band’s music videos in the past, adding further fuel to the fire. However, Banksy’s publicist denied these claims."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maybe-it-s-robert-del-naja>Maybe It's Robert Del Naja...</h2><p>There's a interesting connection between Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja and Banksy&nbsp;that is just too much for some people to ignore. As it turns out, Del Naja is&nbsp;an established&nbsp;graffiti artist&nbsp;that had spent many years working in Bristol&nbsp;going by the name of 3D, who Banksy coincidentally cites as one of his earliest influencers.</p><p>There were a number of instances in which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Banksy's art</a> appeared in areas that Massive Attack was playing live, but Del Naja has actually publicly denied the claim that he could be the man behind the Banksy identity.</p><h2 id=banksy-could-be-a-woman>Banksy Could Be A Woman</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems rather rash to assume that Banksy is a man. There's really no reason to suggest that this artist couldn't be a woman. In fact, many people have drawn their own conclusions and truly believe that Banksy could in fact be a female artist. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">My Art Broker</a> indicates that one of the leaders of this train of thought is "Canadian artist Chris Healey who believed Banksy was a team of seven artists led by a blonde woman who can be seen in Banksy’s studio in his documentary."</p><h2 id=false-alarms>False Alarms</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since a single Banksy installation piece can fetch well over $1 million, the idea of being the person that reveals Banksy's true identity is not only appealing, but it would also be the most riveting revelation in the world of art culture. In an effort to reveal the true identity of this wildly intriguing artists, many have jumped to conclusions and have been proven wrong</p><p>One such example is the case of the mistaken identity of Richard Pfeiffer. Richard and his&nbsp;fiancee were admiring a street installation in Manhattan, when they were suddenly surrounded by p0lice who accused them of being responsible for the street art, since Richard was holding a pen. He was later able to prove that the tip of his pen was not a match to that which was responsible for the art on the street.</p><p>The truth is, Banksy is not likely to be identified unless he- or she- comes forward on their own accord. Until then, miraculous, mesmerizing art continues to surface on popular streets, social media, and art auctions, and the ever-elusive, mysterious artist known to the world as Banksy, continues to reap the benefits of their silent success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Most Valuable Celebrity Art Collections</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The National News</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Art Net</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvorrKrLBmoZSau7W107Jm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
