Getting to see how the children of the show grew up and what they're doing makes for an endless amount of storylines.</p><p>But, when it was announced that the youngest Tanner—Michelle—played by the Olsen twins-wouldn't return, many were sad and instantly started speculating on why.</p><p>Some believe it's because the sisters are too busy with their other endeavors like their fashion line, The Row.</p><p>Furthermore, neither has acted in a long time. Mary-Kate's last role was in the 2011 movie Beastly. In comparison, Ashely hasn't acted since co-starring with her sister in the 2004 movie New York Minute. But, she did pop up—uncredited—in the 2010 biopic I'm Still Here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, when John Stamos announced the spinoff, Mary-Kate told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Women's Wear Daily</a>, "We just found out about it today [the day Stamos announced the show].

Ashley said, "I ran into Bob [Saget] the other day, and we didn't even talk about it. I'm going to call [Saget] and get his perspective."</p><p>"I'm shocked I haven't heard from John [Stamos]," said Mary-Kate.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Fuller House executive producer Robert Boyett said</a>:</p><p>"Although Ashley and Mary-Kate will not be a part of Fuller House, I know how much Full House has meant to them, and they are still very much considered family. It has been exciting to see how they have built their professional careers, and I support their choice to focus on their fashion brands and various business endeavors.

While speaking to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kaitlyn Bristowe on her Off the Vine podcast</a> about the show and whether there's bad blood between the cast and the Olsen twins, Sweetin said:</p><p>"It wasn't like anything bad ever happened. It was just—they were eight years old when the show stopped, so, you know, their whole life existed after. All of their memories, they're pre-8 years old. How much of your life do you remember before you were eight years old? Not much."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>10 Lesser Known Facts About The Olsen Twins' Childhood (And 5 About Elizabeth Olsen)</a></span></p><p>She continues, "So people are like, 'Why didn't they want [to return for Fuller House ]?' Because they were so little. For me, I was 5 to 13; that was like my formative years, my middle school, my elementary school. Like that was it, that was my growing up. For them, they barely were in, like, first grade, and they were, like, done."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sweetin further explains how she found it odd people were certain the twins didn't return because something happened:</p><p>"So, you know, it's just a different experience, and it wasn't like anything bad ever happened. They went off, and they've been wildly successful fashion designers… They're like, 'We've moved on; we don't want to do that anymore,' and I think it was interesting how, like, hung up on that people were. That, like, somehow, it had to be a bad thing, or it had to be an experience, and it was like, 'No, dude, they quit doing this when they were young, and they don't want to do it anymore.'

"I've stopped asking; really, I kind of gave up... But when somebody rings a doorbell, the girls yell, 'It's always open!' on the show, so that's kind of how we feel about the Olsen twins. The door is open."</p><p>When speaking to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Access, the late actor, Bob Saget</a>, said, "I'm not [upset they are not returning].
