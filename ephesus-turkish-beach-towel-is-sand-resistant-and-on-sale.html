There are few things we love more than the beach… but that certainly doesn’t mean a beach day is always a perfect experience. Apart from potential sunburn and jellyfish stings, our towel usually ends up being more of a hindrance than a help. It’s too small, sand sticks to it like glue and it never dries fast enough."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This style of towel isn’t only pretty — it’s going to change your entire beach (or pool!) experience. The best part? A top Amazon pick is on major sale right now!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/amazon-ephesus-turkish-cotton-beach-towel.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ephesus Turkish Beach Towel, Herringbone</a> (originally $40) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$14 </a>at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, June 15, 2023, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>This towel is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">number one bestseller</a> in Amazon’s beach towels category. The Turkish cotton material is lightweight and thin — but still highly absorbent — and has numerous game-changing benefits. First, it allows you to easily shake off excess sand instead of gathering every grain like a magnet. It’s also super quick to dry and doesn’t take on a musty odor. This is especially nice when you have to put it back in the car on the way home!</p><p>Another reason to love Turkish cotton? No more towel lint sticking to your body! This towel also comes pre-washed for softness, and we love how the thinner material makes it so much easier to fit inside beach bags. You can wash it in the machine too — and tumble dry!</p><p>And we haven’t even mentioned the oversized design. No more sunbathing with half your body off the towel!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/amazon-ephesus-turkish-cotton-beach-towel-blue.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ephesus Turkish Beach Towel, Herringbone</a> (originally $40) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$14 </a>at Amazon!

Feel free to use it as a blanket too!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This towel </a>comes in 23 colors with three design variations for each.
