He then&nbsp;admitted&nbsp;that the singer has “every right” to re-record hits like 1989 and Reputation.</p><p>“The person who owned Taylor’s masters throughout her career was not myself, and when I was buying a record label, I actually said to that group, ‘If at any point she wants to come back and be a part of this conversation, please let me know because I wouldn’t do this deal,'” Braun said. “I was shown an email—which has now been made public now—where she stated that she wanted to move on from that negotiation and wasn’t interested in doing that deal anymore.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Tay and Scooter became embroiled in a highly publicized dispute</a> when he got his hands on her masters in 2019 after purchasing her former label, Big Machine Records. The acquisition meant that Taylor lacked the creative freedom of owning the songs from her first six albums.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$42 Million ‘Shake It Off’ Lawsuit Against Taylor Swift Dismissed Again</a></span></p><p>The Bad Blood singer began re-recording the music in 2021, via Republic Records. So far she has re-recorded <i>Fearless </i>and&nbsp;Red, with fans eagerly awaiting the next “Taylor’s Version” release so they can support the star.</p><p>He continued, “I think Taylor has every right to re-record. She has every right to pursue her master's, and I wish her nothing but well, and I have zero interest in saying anything bad about her. I’ve never said anything bad about her in the past, and I won’t start to now. The only thing I disagree with is weaponizing a fanbase.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scooter says his family received "numerous death threats" after Taylor claimed&nbsp;he stopped her from playing her old hits and argued that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her willingness to weaponize her Swifties is incredibly “dangerous.”</a></p><p>“There’s a responsibility with a fanbase,” Scooter said&nbsp;of Taylor's fans, who have been calling him out for years. “The artists I work with have very large fan bases. You don’t do that. It’s very dangerous. There’re people in that fan base who have mental health issues. There are families involved and I think that’s very, very dangerous.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Taylor Swift's $17.75 Million Historic Rhode Island Mansion</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NME</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTApLvOrZyrZZKnrra6jKiiZq%2BZqbVuwMCyo6iqXajEqrLTZqmeZaKasLC%2Bw2aYpZqlosBurtStZKenpGLEpq3PqKWispmjtG6ywKeZmquVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
