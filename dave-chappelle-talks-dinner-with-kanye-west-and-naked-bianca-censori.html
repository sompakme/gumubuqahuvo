According to a Reddit user, who says they attended a Chappelle comedy performance on Monday evening (April 8), the veteran comic began to detail the encounter between West, Censori, and himself during his set. The showgoer also noted West was the subject of numerous jokes told by Chappelle throughout the performance, but that Chappelle made it clear that the two were on good terms and had no beef with one another."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He said it looked like she woke up put some makeup on, slapped some duct tape on her tittys and shoved a cork up her p*ssy and walked out the door.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Chappelle’s alleged jokes regarding West and Censori have yet to surface online, but follows a trend in discourse regarding her propensity for being scantily clad in public. Some have even criticized West for seemingly showcasing Censori’s body for public consumption, an assertion the rapper has taken umbrage with, going as far as<a href=#> defending his incessant posts</a> of his wife on social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2032961428.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Ima post my wife as much as I want, bro,” the Chicago native wrote on Instagram in February 2024. “It makes me happy. Some people don’t want you to be happy. They want you to make them happy. I decided to make myself happy, and I’m happy with that.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">West continued, “I just want to tell everybody I posted my wife three times on purpose. So what I’m saying is, I delivered the album. And people still in my comments talking ’bout, ‘Why you posting your wife?’ Cause <a href=#>she makes me happy. </a>That’s why y’all happy with the music because I’m happy. You understand?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So don’t ever say nothing negative,” he added. “If you don’t like my page and don’t like what I’m posting, go f**k yourself. Seriously…leave the king the f**k alone…I don’t care bro. I’m going to post my wife as much as I want. Go post your wife on your f**king Instagram.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5mut7GMnJ%2BaqKCaua2xjJ2gp6aVp3qsrc2ynGavlajBbrrApJydZZKerq%2BvwGaanqajpL%2BqeZBram1wZm2CcoSO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
