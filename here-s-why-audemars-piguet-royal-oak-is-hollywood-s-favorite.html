The company received popularity with the release of its Grand Compilation Pocket watch in 1899, which featured an alarm and a minute repeater. After launching the world’s thinnest watch in 1946, <a href=#>Audemars Piguet had steady growth until the quartz crisis</a> occurred in the 70s. On the brink of financial collapse, the company created an elegant yet sporty timepiece like never before.</p><p>Steeped deep in the history of Audemars Piguet, the Royal Oak is known as one of the most innovative and beautifully-finished watches the world has ever seen. It is also a celebrity favorite as the Royal Oak is often spotted at various red carpet events. Let’s examine why the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak is Hollywood’s favorite watch.</p><h2 id=a-legendary-history>A Legendary History</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Japanese watch brand Quartz was taking over the world for its mechanical movement in the 1970s, and each Swiss company faced a financial crisis. Audemars Piguet decided to introduce a luxury sports watch. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robb Report</a>, the company brought industrial designer Gérald Genta on board, who had previously worked with Omega and Geneva. Genta received a call at 4 PM to design a steel sports watch and had it ready by the following morning.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 8 Most Expensive Jacob & Co. Watches Owned By Celebrities</a></span></p><h2 id=an-unconventional-design>An Unconventional Design</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The unique design truly makes the Royal Oak stand out and captures the attention of celebrities. Gérald Genta discarded the traditional round shape and switched to a tonneau with an octagonal bezel. It resembles a deep-sea divers helmet, and there are eight octagonal screws often visible on the timepiece. Along with the dial, it also comes with an integrated bracelet and derives its name <a href=#>from the eight British Royal</a> Navy vessels called Royal Oak.</p><h2 id=limited-anniversary-editions>Limited Anniversary Editions</h2><p>It wasn’t until recently that watchmakers began releasing anniversary edition pieces to commemorate even the smallest of occasions. Audemars Piguet jumped on the train as the Royal Oak celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2022. As one of the most sought-after watches in the world, AP released four models in steel, rose gold, yellow gold, and platinum, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>. Only 125 units have been produced for 2022, making it an exceptional timepiece to be added to a watch collection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-favorite-at-bidding-wars>A Favorite At Bidding Wars</h2><p>A watch everyone wants, the Royal Oak has often seen the rounds of various high-end auctions for its original editions. In May 2022, the first Royal Oak owned by the maker Gérald Genta went on auction. Made with an 18-carat gold bezel, the timepiece was created by Genta. After a nerve-racking six-minute bidding war, it was sold to a lucky Swiss watch collector for a whopping $2.1 million, making it the most expensive Royal Oak sold at an auction. The auction didn’t fail to generate the interest of potential buyers.</p><h2 id=notable-brand-ambassadors>Notable Brand Ambassadors</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only does Audemars Piguet eye Hollywood celebrities to buy their products but also to endorse them. Going after the biggest names worldwide, their newest brand ambassador is Serena Williams. Tapping the biggest name in tennis, her fans keenly watched the outfits she wore during her final professional tournament at the US Open 2022. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo News</a>, the sports legend was spotted wearing the Royal Oak Offshore Quartz during her matches. AP welcomed DJ and record producer Mark Ronson as its brand ambassador in 2022.</p><h2 id=the-iterations>The Iterations</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, Audemars Piguet has developed the Royal Oak but maintained the same charm the first timepiece had in 1972. The A-series only produced 1000 units, followed by the B and C series. The first variation came a decade later with the Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar, the world’s thinnest model. AP also released the Royal Oak Day Date Moonphase. For its 20th anniversary, Emmanuel Gueit designed the Royal Oak Offshore, while the Royal Oak Concept was released a decade later. In 2010, AP combined four complications to release the Royal Oak Equation of Time.</p><h2 id=the-high-complication>The High Complication</h2><p>What attracts a watch enthusiast to a timepiece is its engineering and complication. Since its release in the 1970s, the Royal Oak has been one of history's most popular complicated watches. AP continues to update the Royal Oak with new designs and technology. In the newest models released in 2021, the timepiece came with a Supersonnerie development to improve the chiming and acoustic performance, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HypeBeast</a>. The watchmaker has also introduced new shades such as blue and smoked gray.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-stylish-accessory-on-the-red-carpet>A Stylish Accessory On The Red Carpet</h2><p>A versatile watch that goes with any occasion, celebrities and athletes have been enamored by its versatility to be best suited for any event while standing out from the crowd. <a href=#>Steph Curry was spotted wearing the Royal Oak</a> while accepting his MVP award and attending the Met Gala in 2022. John Mayer chose it for his GQ shoot, while Justin Bieber gifted himself one as a wedding gift.</p><p>The Royal Oak has always been a celebrity-favorite watch due to its deep-rooted history and the effortless chic elegance it oozes. Through various collaborations with designers, A-listers have often customized their AP Royal Oak which has a starting price of $45,000. It has been 50 years since the first Royal Oak was made public, and it remains one of the best watches ever produced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Movies Of Sarah Jessica Parker, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robb Report</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo News</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HypeBeast</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8eeqZ6rXay1unnArpuepZGnwG68yKCsnqxdp7y6rctmppqjXZ7AbrTOpaOyr5%2BksbR5xZqtqKqZqbJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
