When Bobby was missing, his blood sugar was down and he was a little confused. I want to thank everybody. Especially Dewey who is The Rock. I want to thank him for being the first person, out of his busy schedule, to reach out to Bobby. I want him to know that my Mom always adored his Mom and thank you so much. It meant so much to me.</p><p>BA: A lot of people don’t know that “Dewey” was The Rock’s&nbsp;nickname when he was a child.</p><p>DE: Right. That’s how I knew him. As “Dewey”. I remember him as a little boy they (The Rock’s family) used to stay at the Days Inn and we would go over there. They’d go have dinner and I’d watch him and Jamie (Dundee). That meant the world to me because I know how busy he is. The fact that he was the first to reach out just touched my heart. My mother adores his mother. She is wonderful.</p><p>BA: He has not let the stardom and the money he has made go to his head. He’s still a down to earth guy.</p><p>This issue of Is Wrestling Fixed? features:</p><ul><li>A brand new, exclusive interview with one half of the legendary pro wrestling tag team The Midnight Express “Beautiful” Bobby Eaton</li><li>Classic audio from Bill’s archives featuring a 1973 interview with “Classy” Freddie Blassie and his manager Capt.
