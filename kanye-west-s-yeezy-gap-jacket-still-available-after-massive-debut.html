The YEEZY founder previously worked at a Gap retail store as a teenager. He references the experience in his 2004 hit “Spaceship.” In 2015, while speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>, Kanye said he views the Gap differently than most consumers thanks to his experience. He added that he’d like to be creative director for the Gap, which seemed to foreshadow his new collaboration.</p><p>Though it was promised the Yeezy Gap line wouldn’t launch until early to mid 2021, the time has finally come. The first item in the collection is a blue, zipperless puffer jacket retailing for a cool $200 USD. It’s made of recycled nylon material and only appears to come in the color blue so far. The YEEZY Gap Round jacket became available on the Gap’s website on June 8th, in order to mark Kanye’s 44th birthday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it wasn’t available for long. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reports that over 50,000 individuals flooded the Gap’s website within the first thirty minutes of the jacket’s launch. It caused erroneous messages to buyers that the jacket was no longer available as it appeared the influx of customers caused the website to temporarily crash. Consumers receiving varying messages. Some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shoppers</a> were redirected to a virtual waiting room, whereas others were informed the jacket was completely sold out, <a href=#>USA Today </a>reports. However, those that did manage to complete their check-out have been told they may not see the product until the fall.</p><p>It’s been confirmed that the Yeezy Gap apparel line will be available both in stores and online. Plus it is still available via the official website. So it likely won’t be long before consumers seem the merchandise lining actual store shelves.</p><p>Note: An earlier version of this article stated that the line had sold-out, due to the error messages. It is, in fact, still available for pre-order.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Most Impressive Mansions Owned By Kim Kardashian and Kanye West</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4orrYnmSwnaOperqxxLOwZp%2BRpXqrrcKknK1lo5q5rb%2BMqKytZZOnrrS0xKxksJ2SqLa1sY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
