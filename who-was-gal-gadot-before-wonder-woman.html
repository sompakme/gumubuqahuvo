Gadot appeared as Wonder Woman again, in 2017's Justice League. Jenkins' follow up about the iconic female hero, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wonder Woman 1984</a>, is currently scheduled to be released on August 14, 2020, after being pushed back from its June 5th release date, due to the Coronavirus. Almost everyone agrees that it seems as if Gal Gadot was made for the role, but who was she before she was Wonder Woman?</p><h2 id=gadot-grew-up-in-a-small-town-in-israel><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Gadot Grew Up In A Small Town In Israel</span></h2><p>Gal Gadot, born on April 30, 1985, grew up in a small town in Israel called Rosh Haayin, with her&nbsp;parents, Irit and Michael Gadot, and younger sister Dana. Gadot has said that it was a "very Jewish, Israeli family environment", and that she spent plenty of time playing outdoors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=growing-up-gadot-wanted-to-be-a-dance-choreographer><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Growing Up, Gadot Wanted To Be A Dance Choreographer</span></h2><p>Gadot has made it no secret that although she liked the spotlight as a child,&nbsp; she never suspected acting was the career for her until she was already doing it.

Although she wasn't particularly interested in doing it, she figured it would be a good experience, and a chance to travel. She ended up winning and going on to compete in Miss Universe, which she purposely tanked.</p><h2 id=after-her-pageant-experience-she-started-modeling><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>After Her Pageant Experience, She Started Modeling</span></h2><p>Taking part in the Miss Israel and Miss Universe pageants brought her into the modeling world.

However, the show was short lived, and only ran from 2007 to 2008.</p><h2 id=she-finally-landed-her-breakout-role-in-fast-amp-furious><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Finally Landed Her Breakout Role&nbsp;In Fast & Furious</span></h2><p>The same casting director that was interested in Gadot for the Bond girl role, eventually cast Gadot in her first major role as Gisele in Fast & Furious.
