When asked about his insane amount of face and heel turns over the years, Wight admitted that he’s had more turns than NASCAR, but he remembers some of the key ones.</p><p>“I’ve had more turns than NASCAR. I remember some of the key ones,” Paul Wight said. “Seems like every time we did a brand, I would tear my shirt off, and I’d be on the other brand. That seems like that turned into a rib. RAW to SmackDown or SmackDown to RAW and all that crap. I think one of the better turns was the turn on Cena. That was a good one.</p><p>“Sometimes, I would turn, and I remember being at the gorilla position, and my joke with Vince was, ‘Am I smiling or not?’ ‘Cause I didn’t know. We were working so much. ‘Am I smiling or not?’ He’d be like, ‘Smile! Big smile!’ ‘Okay, I’m a good guy.’ ‘No smile.’ ‘Okay, I’m a bad guy, got it.’ Sometimes, you just gotta go with the flow and be versatile.</p><p>“It kept me employed for a long time because I was able to be the heel that an upcoming babyface had to beat to move on to the next level. Then when I was a babyface, I was the one that could help an upcoming heel get some heat. For me, it kept me employed and kept me working, kept me in the game.”</p><h2 id=h-paul-wight-prefers-being-a-heel>Paul Wight prefers being a heel</h2><p>Wight would go on to admit that from a psychological standpoint, he preferred telling stories as a heel.</p><p>“I think it was easier to be a heel,” Paul Wight admitted. “Because it’s easier to tell that story from a psychological standpoint. People understand presence and size and all that. I think babyface was a little harder sometimes because if you’re selling and your opponent’s not aggressive enough, they kind of go, ‘C’mon, you big pussy. Get up,’ you know what I mean? ‘No, I’m trying to sell. He’s just really doesn’t know what to do yet.’</p><p>“But as a heel, I think it was easier because I had more control over the match on how things went, and the heel is very important in a match, especially in a giant match. The heel is very important for setting a lot of the tone and a lot of the pace and setting up the babyface. So I felt like I did a really good job of working with talent as a heel and setting them up, then either when they picked me up or did whatever they did, it meant something.” [H/T: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fightful</a>]</p><p><a href=#>Paul Wight Turns Heel (Again), Sides With The UK In ‘Snack Wars’</a></p><p>What do you make of Paul Wight’s comments?
