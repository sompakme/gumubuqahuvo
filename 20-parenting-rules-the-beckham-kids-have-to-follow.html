They have all other super couples beat when it comes to glitz, glamour and media attention. From the moment they started dating, the entire world has been watching their romance unfold. Instantly, fans and the media dubbed them “Posh & Becks”. They were both already major stars around the world, but the marriage raised their profile. They’re both considered fashion icons, trendsetters and the most beautiful people alive. One question remained on the minds of people all over the world: What will happen when those genes mix? Posh & Becks made even bigger headlines around the world when they started a family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Victoria and David have four kids together that range in age from very young to teenagers. Their parenting style has always been under a great deal of scrutiny. Due to their high profile, their children’s lives are under the harsh media spotlight as well. Regardless of their standing in the world, Posh & Becks are parents first. They have several rules that their children most adhere to. Here is a look at 20 Rules The Beckham Kids Have To Follow.</p><h2 id=the-polite-boys><strong>The Polite Boys</strong></h2><p>Despite being wealthy and world famous celebs, David and Victoria Beckham are one of the strictest celebrity couples. Celeb parents find it difficult to raise humble and down-to-earth kids when they grow up privileged. It’s important to David and Victoria that the kids are well behaved. All four of their kids most follow their rules, but David was a bit stricter with the three boys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Raising children is not easy, but raising three boys is pure madness. Both David and Victoria grew up in strict households and want the same for their kids. They’ve enforced strict rules and the importance of manners on the kids from a very young age. David noted, “They've been saying their please and thank-yous since they were two or three years old. They're very polite boys.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailyMailUK</a>)</p><h2 id=the-polite-girl><strong>The Polite Girl</strong></h2><p>In 1997, an event so profound and impactful occurred that it would change the world forever. That’s right, David and Victoria started dating and the entire world took notice. Some fans thought it was just a fling and other’s hoped differently. They started dating after meeting at a charity&nbsp;soccer match and married in 1999. The couple enjoys their privacy and had a private wedding ceremony.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As noted, their kids being well behaved and having manners is of the utmost importance to the superstar couple. Victoria said, “It was very important to me and David that our kids had manners, but while having good manners, our children are also a lot of fun.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MyDomaine</a>) Even their youngest daughter has impeccable manners and has been saying her please and thank you since she was four.</p><h2 id=the-coffee-shop-employee><strong>The Coffee Shop Employee</strong></h2><p>David and Victoria Beckham are two of the wealthiest celebs in the world. David has an estimated net worth of $450 million and Victoria also has an estimated net worth of $450 million. Their kids grew up living a very privileged life but they made sure the kids were aware of that.</p><p><strong>Victoria said, “David and I explain to the children what privileged lives they lead. We tell them that in many places in the world children are hungry, homeless and sick.”</strong></p><p>Additionally, the children don’t get to live off their wealthy parents forever. When Brooklyn was old enough they encouraged him to get a part-time job at a coffee shop. Posh & Becks are the perfect role models for the kids to look up to. David said, “We try to lead by example, by showing them it’s important to work hard.”(<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MyDomaine</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=posh-amp-becks-control-the-kids-social-media><strong>Posh & Becks Control The Kids Social Media</strong></h2><p>Social media is a significant part of most people’s lives but for some teenagers it is their life. Celebs use social media as a way to connect with their fans and expand their fan base. However, social media is also known for its online bullying and harassment. Additionally, Celebs are known for often getting themselves into trouble on social media.</p><p><strong>Victoria and David are more than well aware of the&nbsp;dangers that come with social media and being a celebrity.</strong></p><p>The famous duo has complete control of their kids Instagram and Twitter accounts. They control what their kids post online. Back when Brooklyn was 16, he had roughly 4.4 million followers on Instagram. David said,“We control everything he posts, everything that he does, and it's the same with our other kids.”(<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HelloMagazine</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=respect-and-discipline><strong>Respect and&nbsp;</strong><b>Discipline</b></h2><p>The Beckhams have a long list of rules their kids must follow. For the most part, the rules are simple and easy to follow. At the top of their list is for the kids to show respect. David was concerned that it would be difficult to raise kids similar to his childhood.</p><p><strong>He said, “Their upbringing is a lot different to my upbringing so I think there is always a kind of fear factor… I mean, the first day that you have kids, you constantly worry.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Closer</a>)</strong></p><p>It was very important to them that their kids have a strong sense of respect for the rules. He added, “Me and Victoria were brought up with strong discipline by our parents and to have respect for people and our boys have definitely got that.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailyMailUK</a>)</p><h2 id=the-dating-rules><strong>The Dating Rules</strong></h2><p>Posh & Becks have three sons, Brooklyn (19), Romeo (15) and Cruz (13). For a few years it seemed that the Beckhams were done having kids. In 2011, they had their fourth child and only daughter Harper (6). With the boys getting older, dating has become a big topic in the Beckham home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>A few years ago David said, “Obviously Brooklyn is definitely at that age. You know, he's 16, he's definitely at that age.”</strong></p><p>However, Brooklyn’s parents have a set of strict dating rules and guidelines he must follow. His brothers will also have to follow the same strict dating rules. However, the youngest and only girl, Harper, might have a different set of rules. When asked what the dating rules would be for Harper David laughed and said, “Oh yeah. That'll definitely be different." (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HelloMagazine</a>)</p><h2 id=good-kids-at-school><strong>Good Kids&nbsp;At School</strong></h2><p>David and Victoria Beckham enforce strict rules on their kids and ensure that they are always respectful. However, that doesn’t only apply to being at home. Kids can often be a handful in school and difficult to deal with. However, there is no way that Victoria and David would raise kids that acted that way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>They stressed the importance of being well-behaved kids at school. In fact, it’s so important to the Beckhams that it’s the first thing on their minds when meeting with&nbsp;teachers.</strong></p><p>David said, “That's one of the first questions that we ask when we go for meetings at school is about their manners: and it's one of the first things their teachers say - that they've got impeccable manners.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailyMailyUK</a>) Their kids never cause or get into any trouble at school.</p><h2 id=three-boys-and-a-tomboy><strong>Three Boys and a Tomboy&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Victoria Beckham rose to fame as a member of the incredibly popular girl-group The Spice Girls. She went by the name “Posh Spice” and became a worldwide star. Later, she married David Beckham and for a while was just the wife of a great soccer player. However, she quickly changed that by becoming one of the biggest fashion designers in the world and built an impressive empire. She works incredibly hard at her career and raising a family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>She wants her kids to follow their passions as long as they work hard at it. However, the revelation that her daughter wants to play&nbsp;soccer too was a “dagger in the heart”.</strong></p><p>She added,“I have three boys who want to play football, come on, let one of them want to be in fashion or dance.” Despite Harper being a tomboy, Victoria noted,“She loves fashion as all little girls do, she loves putting makeup on and playing with my shoes.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent</a>)</p><h2 id=choosing-their-own-path><strong>Choosing Their Own Path</strong></h2><p>David Beckham first became a household name because of his illustrious&nbsp;soccer career. He was active from 1992 to 2013 and won various championships. He played for several popular teams, including, Real Madrid, Milan and Manchester United. Enforcing strict rules isn’t Beckham’s only technique. They’re incredibly supportive of their kid’s choices just as long as they work and work hard. David is even okay if the kids don’t want to follow in his footsteps.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>He said, “One of my boys turned around to me the other day and said,&nbsp;‘Daddy, you know, I'm not sure I want to play football all the time’…It broke my heart a little bit.”</strong></p><p>The reason being his son felt a lot of pressure being his father’s son. However, David responded,“Okay, stop right there... You play because you want to play.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent</a>)</p><h2 id=hardworking-family><strong>Hardworking Family</strong></h2><p>The Beckhams are two of the most recognizable and gorgeous celebs alive. In addition to being a fashion designer and legendary player, both Posh & Becks have graced the covers of all the top magazines. Their eldest, Brooklyn, is already following in his beautiful parents footsteps. He made his parents proud when he landed his first Teen Vogue cover.</p><p><strong>Victoria said, “I was so proud. I mean imagine, my baby on the cover of Vogue! Very exciting.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MyDomaine</a>)</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The kids are still young but they’re starting to follow several creative passions. David and Victoria always lead by example and show the kids what hardworking is all about. David said, “We juggle everything around the family because our main priority is the children, simple as that, and it always will be, but being hardworking is the best thing you can show children.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Closer</a>)</p><h2 id=brooklyn-didn-t-know-they-were-famous-until-13><strong>Brooklyn Didn’t Know They Were Famous Until 13</strong></h2><p>Many famous parents face the dilemma of raising their kids in a world where they are already superstars before they can even walk. There isn’t a person in the world that doesn’t know that Victoria and David Beckham are two of the biggest stars in the world. Well, for a few years there was actually one person who had no idea.</p><p>David and Victoria hid the fact that they were a famous family from their eldest, Brooklyn. It might seem impossible but he had no idea he was a member of a famous family until he was 13. He said, “I went to a football game and people were shouting my dad’s name and I was like, ‘What?! Oh my God.’ I don’t look at them like that.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NYDailynews</a>) This was done to ensure the kids don’t grow up feeling entitled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=letting-them-choose><strong>Letting Them Choose</strong></h2><p>David and Victoria Beckham have many strict rules they expect their children to follow. However, one of their rules includes letting the kids do what makes them feel good. A few years ago, the Beckhams received a great deal of criticism for letting their then 4-year-old daughter Harper use a pacifier. Many critics felt she was too old to use a pacifier but David defended his choice to let her use a soother.</p><p>He said, "Everybody who has children knows that when they aren't feeling well or have a fever you do what comforts them best and most of the time it's a pacifier so those who criticize think twice about what you say about other people's children because actually you have no right to criticize me as a parent.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>)</p><h2 id=family-day><strong>Family Day</strong></h2><p>This might be a rule for the kids but it’s really about Posh & Becks spending time with their family. Both have insanely busy schedules but always make sure they spend quality time with the children. The weekends are usually packed with family outings regardless of what the kids want to do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>According to Victoria, all the kids want to do on the weekend is “jump on their skateboards.” However, the Beckhams often take their kids to art museums and visit extraordinary exhibits.</strong></p><p>The kids might not always enjoy it but it’s important to the parents. However, from time to time the kids do enjoy the exhibits&nbsp;at least for a little while. Victoria added, “I took all of them to the Tracey Emin exhibition not too long ago, which they loved, for about 10 minutes, then they wanted to go jump on their skateboards.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MyDomaine</a>)</p><h2 id=the-kids-will-definitely-work><strong>The Kids&nbsp;Will Definitely Work</strong></h2><p>Oftentimes, celeb kids want to follow in their parent’s footsteps and enter showbiz. Some celeb parents are actually against the idea while others push for it. Posh & Becks encourage their kids to follow their creative pursuits but they don’t have to be like their parents.</p><p><strong>Their third child, Cruz, has already released his first single “If Every Day was Christmas.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Victoria and David often praise their eldest, Brooklyn, for his&nbsp;soccer skills, photography talent and eye for art. Brooklyn said,“I love football, but I'm also very passionate about photography and film. I'm keeping my options open right now.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VogueUK</a>) The Beckhams just want their children to choose a career that makes them happy, but they have to work. Victoria noted, “They won’t be these children that stay at home and don’t do anything. They will definitely work.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MyDomaine</a>)</p><h2 id=work-ethic><strong>Work Ethic</strong></h2><p>Posh & Becks are strong believers in leading by example. It is incredibly important to them that their kids know the value of hard work and a dollar. The Beckhams have both worked very hard in their respective careers and business ventures. Additionally, they come from strict backgrounds and grew up very disciplined. They have taught their children the importance of having a strong work ethic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>However, they have set a great example of having a good work ethic and earning everything in life. David has the perfect motivation to working hard and tries to teach his kids.</strong></p><p>He said, “My children are my motivation. Simple as that. I want to prove to them that if you work hard you can be successful.”(<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Closer</a>) The Beckham kids are already proving they have a good work ethic.</p><h2 id=mom-s-no-soccer-in-the-house-rule><strong>Mom’s No&nbsp;soccer In The House Rule</strong></h2><p>David Beckham is widely regarded as one of the greatest&nbsp;soccer players of all time. He had a huge impact on the sport both internationally and back home. In the U.K., he’s widely considered a cultural icon. He influenced an entire generation of current and future footballers. It should come as no surprise that football is very popular in the Beckham home.</p><p><strong>Their eldest, Brooklyn, confirmed that Posh & Becks are very strict although in different ways. He said, “They're both strict, but about different things. Mum is constantly telling us not to play football in the house.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Victoria admits that is she is powerless to stop the&nbsp;soccer playing in the home. She said, “That seems to be the one area I can't discipline them, they will not stop playing football in the house!” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailymailUK</a>)</p><h2 id=helping-others><strong>Helping Others</strong></h2><p>The Beckham kids are lucky to have rich and famous parents. Their lives are more privileged than others.</p><p><strong>David said, “They are very privileged and they have a lovely life, and I want to protect that and to protect them from anything that goes on outside the family.”</strong></p><p>The celebrity couple tried to raise their kids to be simple and humble, which is hard considering the amount of money they make. They have stressed that the Beckham kids have lives better than a majority of the kids in the world. It seems to be working since the kids already participate in charity events and help raise money for the less fortune. Victoria said, “Romeo ran the children’s marathon earlier this year and raised an amazing amount of money through sponsorship, which he divided between David’s charity and UNAIDS.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ibtimes</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=strict-and-cool><strong>Strict and Cool</strong></h2><p>David and Victoria Beckham grew up having proper manners and followed their parent’s strict rules. They decided early on that they’d impose strict rules on the kids.</p><p><strong>David said, “We want to bring them up as closely as possible to how we were brought, because you have to give them manners, you have to give them boundaries and our children definitely have that.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Closer</a>)</strong></p><p>However, they also know the importance of easing up on the rules. They let their kids have fun and enjoy themselves. It’s not all about following strict rules. In fact, they’re very relaxed when it comes to Brooklyn’s curfew although he still tries to make it back early. He said, “My parents are really cool and I never get in that late anyway.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailymailUK</a>) It’s every parents dream to be called “cool” by their kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lead-by-example><strong>Lead By Example</strong></h2><p>It’s important to Posh & Becks that the kids understand the importance of hard work. Through sheer determination and hard work they have become two of the most recognizable stars in the world.</p><p><strong>Victoria said, “David and I both have a strong work ethic and I believe that’s a good example to set our children.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!News</a>)</strong></p><p>They’ve both built an impressive empire off of their world famous careers. However, it took a great deal of work to make it to the heights they've reached. Their children are the center of their universe and they want the best for them. They want them to be hard working and honest people like they are. David said, “That’s one of the key things me and my wife have always done, (both) before we had children, and now we have four children.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HuffingtonPostUK</a>)</p><h2 id=hard-work-good-manners-discipline-and-respect><strong>Hard Work, Good Manners,&nbsp;Discipline&nbsp;and Respect</strong></h2><p>David and Victoria Beckham are strict parents, but are very proud of their kids. They always display respectful manners everywhere they go. Currently, they have no plans on adding a 5th child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>David said, “I would love number five but my wife's very happy with the four that we have, and obviously so am I. So number five, I don't think so.”</strong></p><p>If they decided to have a 5th child, odds are they’d also be very mannered and disciplined. It would be hard for the kids not to grow up to become well-behaved kids considering the role models living in their house. David said, “I have proved that over the last 15 years, after we had our first son Brooklyn, that I have always been a hard worker and Victoria is exactly the same.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Closer</a>)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGK9or7Ep6uippdiv7a4xKxkraCVYq%2Bmr8qhmKZlm56xtHnHmq2eZaSkeqe7y6WmsGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
