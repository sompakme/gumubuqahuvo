The home features a guest house, private theatre, resort-inspire pool and spa, and a three-car garage. The co-parents originally brought the property in 2018 for $13.5 million.</p><p>Kylie has brought in professional help to sell the home. In November, she reportedly hired professional home stager Meredith Baer.</p><p>The house decorating specialist gave an interview to PEOPLE, explaining she wanted the décor to still reflect Kylie’s personal taste while helping potential buyers envisioning themselves in the home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"<a href=#>We wanted to nod to Kylie's love</a> of the blush and nude colors that she uses in her skincare line," she explained. "Overall, the style is what we would call organic modern. So, a lot of the furniture is very, very natural, peaceful, simple. At the same time, we have edgy, bold art and a lot of unique pottery pieces."</p><p>“What's interesting is they didn't tell us what to do. We picked up the cue of her own taste. The colors and looks that she loves are what guided, so it was like an homage to her,” she added.</p><p>Kylie still owns several other properties in the area, including a $12 million home in Hidden Hills. Her man residence is reportedly a $36.5 million mansion in Holmby Hills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Lana Del Rey Gets Engaged With $300,000 Diamond Ring</a></span></p><p>Sources: Marca, Us Weekly, PEOPLE,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaksZyesm62xKelnqpdqb%2BiwsisZKybn6nBbrDErKeeqpGpsq3FjK2psqGenHq1u4ysnKWkXaKur7%2FIqKVmmZapsrN5waucmqNdqr1w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
