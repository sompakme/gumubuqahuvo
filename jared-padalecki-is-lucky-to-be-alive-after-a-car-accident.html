Sorry to miss y’all in NYC this weekend. Thank you and the #WalkerFamily for all the love and support. Can’t wait to see y’all again. 🙏❤️,” he wrote via <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p>Ackles assured the audience that he spoke with his fellow Texas native, who said it was OK for his former costar to share some details with the audience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jared-Padalecki.jpg><p>“He was in a very bad car accident,” the <a href=#>Boys</a> star explained, eliciting gasps from the concerned fans. “He wasn’t driving. He was in the passenger seat, and he’s lucky to be alive.”</p><p>Ackles, who played Padalecki’s brother for 15 seasons <a href=#>on the CW hit series</a>, added that there were no deaths associated with the accident. However, the Radio Company singer was shocked that Padalecki wasn’t even in the hospital.</p><p>“He’s at home recovering, which — the fact that he’s not even in the hospital right now is, like, blowing my mind because I saw the car,” he said.</p><p>When the collision happened, the vehicle’s air bags inflated, which left Padalecki exhausted. “That airbag packs a punch,” Ackles added. “He’s like, ‘I feel like I went 12 rounds with Tyson.’ But he is doing OK, and he’s moving around. But yeah, [it was a] really, really bad car accident. Just keep him in your thoughts, send him some love if you get a chance on social and he’ll be back with us soon.”</p><p>The former costars <a href=#>made headlines last year</a> when the <a href=#>Gilmore Girls alum</a> learned of the Supernatural prequel series that Ackles is producing, titled The Winchesters, via social media rather than in person.</p><p>“Dude. Happy for you. Wish I heard about this some way other than Twitter. I’m excited to watch, but bummed that Sam Winchester had no involvement whatsoever,” Padalecki tweeted in June 2021.</p><p>However, the two <a href=#>made amends quickly</a>. “@JensenAckles and I had a great talk, as we do often, and things are good. The show is early in the process with miles to go. We’ve travelled a lot of roads together, and sometimes those damn roads have bumps,” he tweeted one day later. “Bumps don’t stop us. Once brothers, always brothers.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The pair have since made several convention appearances together, and Ackles directed an episode of Padalecki’s show, Walker.</p><p>The<a href=#> New York Minute star</a> is married to<a href=#><strong> Genevieve Padalecki</strong> </a>(née Cortese), and they share three kids: Thomas, 10, Shep, 8, and Odette, 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaKasW68wJ2YpZ2ToLZutdJmo66bm656tbuMm5xmmZyew6Z5wJ%2BrnqpdlnqkrdFmmJybmZmyr8CO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
