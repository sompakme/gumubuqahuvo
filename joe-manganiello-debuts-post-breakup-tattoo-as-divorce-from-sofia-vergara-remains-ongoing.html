Rather, it seems to be a clear nod to his Armenian ancestry. Joe has been vocal about his roots, including how his great-grandmother survived the Armenian Genocide, later relocating to the U.S.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sofia Vergara Called Out David Letterman During Their Awkward Interview, But Was She Actually Angry About His Comment?</a></span></p><h2 id=joe-and-sofia-allegedly-split-because-she-doesn-rsquo-t-want-kids>Joe And Sofia Allegedly Split Because She Doesn’t Want Kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screen-shot-2023-08-26-at-8-41-50-am.png><p>Joe filed for divorce from Sofia earlier this month, citing irreconcilable differences.
