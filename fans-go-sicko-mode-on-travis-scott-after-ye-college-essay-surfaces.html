The 33-year-old rapper wrote about <a href=# id=auto-tag_kanye-west data-tag=kanye-west>Kanye West</a>‘s <a href=#>G.O.O.D Music</a> label and its signees <a href=#>Kid Cudi</a> and <a href=#>Big Sean</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Houston rapper attended the University of Texas at San Antonio before dropping out to pursue a full-time music career. In 2009, he seemingly wrote an essay about Ye and the label he would later sign to as a producer. “Good Music is known all around the world,” Scott wrote. “Rappers such as Big Sean and Kid Cudi are well-known rappers that had similar lifestyles but different messages. What they had in common carried them an opportunity to get sign to an multi-million dollar company called G.O.O.D MUSIC.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He gushed over Cudi and Sean’s courage to approach Ye through a myriad of typos. “Both of these rappers had enough courage to step up to the famous Kanye West and rap there heart which led them to instant success,” he wrote. “Even though these two moguls are sign to the same label and are part of the same music family there styles and there background are different but they were brought together by a beautiful sound we call music.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Neither Travis Scott nor the university have confirmed whether this essay is real or not, but internet users didn’t need the truth to let their jokes off. “This mf had no choice but to be a rapper he stupid as hell,” one fan wrote on social media. “College…?” one fan asked while another speculated that he wrote the essay five minutes before his class began.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While a major in English clearly wasn’t Scott’s forte, he seemingly manifested his future success with the contents of this essay. He signed with G.O.O.D Music in 2012 and has been one of Kanye West’s constant collaborators in the ensuing years. He also worked with Kid Cudi on numerous occasions and at one point, the duo even promoted a joint album which was <a href=#>later shelved</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Scott’s relationship with Ye and G.O.O.D Music helped him to break through and become one of music’s biggest stars today. Most recently, he released his latest LP <a href=#>Utopia </a>in July 2023. The album featured Drake, Bad Bunny, The Weeknd, Beyoncé, SZA, Future, Playboi Carti, and more. Utopia debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and maintained the top spot on the chart for four weeks. It has remained on the chart for 42 weeks, closing in on his 2015 album Rodeo which was on the Billboard 200 for 59 weeks.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Travis Scott also recently appeared on Future and Metro Boomin’s March 2024 collaborative album <a href=#>We Don’t Trust You</a>. He was featured on “<a href=#>Type Sh*t</a>” alongside Playboi Carti and “Cinderella.” In January, he joined 21 Savage on “Née-Nah” from his latest album American Dream. The 10-time Grammy nominee also joined <a href=#>Tyla on the remix</a> to her popular record “Water” in November 2023 and “Aye” from Lil Uzi Vert’s June 2023 album Pink Tape.
