I can honestly say, I am friends with everybody on the show.”</p><p>She continued, “If there’s somebody particular that you’re asking me about, I just think that natural selection takes over.”</p><p>When revealing her best friends from the first Golden Bachelor season, Kathy named <strong>Susan Noles</strong> and <strong>Nancy Hulkower</strong>.</p><p>“Nancy, Susan and I just got back from St. Martin and had a great time,” Kathy continued. “I might say we did not leave that island in one piece, but we had a great time.”</p><p>She added, “I think, like any other season, when you have a bunch of women who are trying to date one man, things happen and people aren’t necessarily themselves. That’s life, it goes on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Golden-Bachelor-Kathy-Swarts-Dodges-Questions-About-ASKN-Drama-3.jpg><p>The trio’s recent vacation raised eyebrows among Bachelor Nation fans as fellow Golden Bachelor alum <strong>April Kirkwood</strong> noticeably missing from the trip. The foursome — April, Susan, Kathy and Nancy — referred to themselves as the ASKN ladies while vying for <strong>Gerry Turner’</strong>s heart on the ABC spinoff, which aired last fall.</p><p>“For all of the folks from Texas and PA that are daunting me about why I am not going to St. Martin. Although it is none of your business and there are only three people who knew I cancelled but karma never sleeps,” April wrote in a lengthy Instagram caption from January, listing six “reasons” why she did not go to St. Martin.</p><p>“1. I have a job and I can’t keep taking off. 2. My roof had a major leak and I had to pay $4,500.00 so I can’t afford to go. 3. My dogs are freaking out. 4. My son’s birthday is this week and he doesn’t need to see me on a beach at this time in our relationship,” April wrote. “5. I have to go to NY to see my granddaughter and celebrate her 3rd birthday in three weeks so I will be off then. 6. I’m an adult and I have to make decisions that are best for my first love…not partying but my kids and keeping my house.”</p><p>April concluded her caption by seemingly throwing shade at the other three women, hinting that they were the “only three people” who knew that she backed out of the trip.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Golden-Bachelor-Kathy-Swarts-Dodges-Questions-About-ASKN-Drama-1.jpg><p>“This is adult bullying and it is a low, dense energy,” April claimed. “This is a poor example of what adult females should act like.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Bachelor Nation</a> fans picked up on the drama after the ASKN ladies made their Bachelor debut during the third episode of <strong>Joey Graziadei</strong>’s season on Monday, February 5.</p><p>For a complete recap of week 3 of Joey’s season, listen to Us Weekly’s <a href=# rel=noopener>“Here for the Right Reasons”</a> podcast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagp5yZsq95wZqaoZ2cpL%2B0ecqaq6GxXajEor7TrGSdp5ScsrR50K6crKyZpLu0ecCbpq6sXZbArLqMnamapZFk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
