Luke Macfarlane has been a Hallmark Channel staple since 2014 — and after signing a multi-picture deal with the network in May he doesn’t appear to be going anywhere.
The Brothers & Sisters alum made his Hallmark Movies & Mysteries debut with 2014’s The Memory Book. The following year, he starred in his first holiday film for Hallmark Channel with Christmas Land alongside Nikki DeLoach.
Macfarlane has since appeared in both seasonal and Christmas favorites for Crown Media Family Network including The Birthday Wish, Just Add Romance and Sense, Sensibility & Snowmen."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The <a href=#>Bros star</a>’s commitment to Hallmark’s parent company comes amid competition with GAC Media for the same talent after former Hallmark boss <strong>Bill Abbott</strong> <a href=#>launched the rival network in 2021</a>.</p><p>Before his new deal, Macfarlane had already cemented himself as one of Hallmark’s leading men. However, his role in Moriah’s Lighthouse, playing American architect Ben, could be his best film yet. In the movie, Ben throws a wrench in artist Moriah’s (<a href=#><strong>Rachelle Lefevre</strong></a>) plans to restore a local lighthouse when he arrives in the French seaside town — but those differences might just lead to love.</p><p>The Normal Heart actor teased the scenic backdrop of the new film <a href=#>while in Europe earlier this spring</a>. “Ciel couvert à Britney France,” he captioned an April Instagram photo, which means “overcast sky” in Britney, France, which is where they worked.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Moriah’s Lighthouse premieres on Hallmark Channel Saturday, June 18, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Macfarlane:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BhwqyxjKaYnJ6Rp7miusRmnp6sXam8brfNqK5moJGhua6t0aSqZqWfp7aitNJmo6KfmKm1sMHSnmSsrJGnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
