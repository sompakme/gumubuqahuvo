So, they were like, ‘Hey, what about this part of Andrew?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, I’ll do anything. This show’s awesome and you’re awesome. Just tell me where to go and where to stand and I’ll try not to f—k it up,’” the <a href=#>former basketball player</a> told&nbsp;<a href=#><i>W&nbsp;</i>magazine</a> in a December 2022 profile. “It was actually a total pivot into this kind of dick, douchey role, which was super fun.”</p><p class=p1>He continued at the time: “The role was pretty foreign to me in terms of personality. He’s very intense and academically inclined. Not that I wasn’t academically inclined, but I was never incredibly serious about it to the point where I would get mad at a classmate. … They sort of flip the sitcom idea of that revolving door [of love interests]. They flip the genders there, which is so much fun. And I’m honored to be part of that revolving door.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>While Andrew and Whitney ultimately went their separate ways by the end of season 2, Louis-Dreyfus was <a href=#>proud of her son’s acting experience.</a></p><p class=p1>“It means that my children now really respect what I do for a living,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Thunderbolts&nbsp;</i></a>star previously gushed to&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;</i>in September 2022. “He’s really digging being an actor and he’s really good.
