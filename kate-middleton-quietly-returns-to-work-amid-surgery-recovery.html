On Tuesday, March 19, it was reported that The London Clinic launched an investigation after members of the hospital allegedly attempted to access the princess’ private health documents records following her operation in January.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MEGA1108751_001.jpg><p>According to the Daily Mail, the investigation occurred after one staff member tried to access Kate’s notes on file without permission.</p><p>Kensington Palace confirmed that the princess was aware of the situation, and that “This is a matter for the London Clinic.”</p><p><a href=#>The London Clinic CEO <strong>Al Russell</strong> spoke out </a>on Wednesday, March 20, about the matter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MEGA1060397_002.jpg><p>“Everyone at The London Clinic is acutely aware of our individual, professional, ethical and legal duties with regards to patient confidentiality,” Russell said in a statement to <a href=# rel=noopener>NBC News</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The palace had announced in January that Kate underwent a “planned abdominal surgery” and would be “unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter.”</p><p>While they noted that the surgery was “successful,” they have been tight-lipped about details surrounding the procedure. The limited details, and the princess’ absence from public life have left many royal watchers speculating about the current state of her health.</p><p><a href=#>She was recently spotted</a> alongside <strong>Prince William</strong> during an outing at Windsor Farm Shop, per a video obtained by Us. In the clip, Kate and William, 41, carried shopping bags from their trip. One eyewitness told TMZ that “Kate looked happy and relaxed.” But this has done little to quell the conspiracy theories and curiosity about her well-being.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSaeq61w52jnqyfo3qywcieq6WxXaeytcHRp6pmrJ9ixLC%2BymaYpqGUYsC2vsaeqbJlopqwsMLEq7Bo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
