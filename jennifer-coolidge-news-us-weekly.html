Coolidge’s breakout role was as Stifler’s Mom in the 1999 raunchy teen sex comedy American Pie, later reprising her role in the long-running franchise in American Pie 2, American Wedding and American Reunion. She soon reunited with American Pie costar <a href=#><strong>Eugene Levy</strong></a> in <strong>Christopher Guest</strong>‘s A Mighty Wind, which was released one year later. The Massachusetts native went on to appear in multiple Guest films, including Best in Show, For Your Consideration and more.</p><p>Coolidge’s star only continued to rise in the 2000s, thanks to fan-favorite films like Legally Blonde, A Cinderella Story, Zoolander and many more. She notably starred in a 2003 episode of Friends, in which she famously played Monica (<a href=#><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></a>) and Phoebe’s (<a href=#><strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong></a>) old roommate Amanda Buffamonteezi.</p><p>As the Watcher star’s acting career stretched into the 2010s and 2020s — with starring roles on 2 Broke Girls, in the Oscar-nominated A Promising Young Woman and in <a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>‘s “Thank U, Next” music video — she quickly began hitting her stride.</p><p>The entertainment industry entered the “Jenaissance” once The White Lotus premiered in 2021. Coolidge earned multiple nominations — and multiple awards — for her portrayal of Tanya on the critically-acclaimed HBO series. In September 2022, she won her first-ever Emmy for the role, which she later followed up in early 2023 with a Golden Globe and two SAG Award wins.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnmpq7r7XFnqlmm5%2Bkuaqwxp5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
