Being the son of a former Spice Girl and soccer player has gifted him many things that many crave. So much so that many have openly<a href=#> criticized Brooklyn for purchasing a $10 million home</a> in L.A. Given the fact that he simply just doesn't have much in the way of a career has been the main source of controversy. But Brooklyn comes from a lot of money, <a href=#>as does his fiance, Nicola Peltz</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the level of attention David and Victoria Beckham's son, as well as his current partner, have been receiving in the press, a lot of fans have questions. Mainly, what is it actually like to date the handsome, tattooed young man? Given what he and Nicola share on their social media, it appears as though both are a literal match made in heaven. Everything they present fans with is glitzy, glossy, and undeniably hot. But the truth may not be as pleasant as it appears. At least, according to some of Brookyln's ex-girlfriends.</p><h2 id=brooklyn-39-s-fiance-thinks-the-world-of-him>Brooklyn's Fiance Thinks The World Of Him</h2><p>Before you can get into some of the things Brooklyn's exes have said about him, you certainly need to take into account what his current partner has said. A quick look at Nicola Peltz's Instagram and you'll see that she practically holds Brooklyn up on a pedestal. The same is true for how Brooklyn sees his gorgeous Transformers-star fiance. Unlike many couples who simply love each other, these two have to constantly announce their adoration to the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After just nine months, Nicola and Brooklyn got engaged and took their PDA up about 20 notches. Brooklyn had no problem letting Nicola mark her territory by<a href=#> getting a tattoo of her on his body</a>. But Nicola has basically done the same by posting hundreds of photos of her kissing Brooklyn, talking about what a "man" he is, how "kind' his heart is, and how she is excited to spend the rest of her life with him.</p><p>On top of all the rave reviews Brooklyn gets from his fiance, he also received quite a lot of positive comments from singer and model Madison Beer. While Brooklyn and Madison never dated, they did hook up and have been friends for years. But it's likely Brookyln's affection for Nicola ended any possibility of it turning into something else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-picture-his-exes-paint-is-very-different>The Picture His Exes Paint Is Very Different</h2><p>It should come as no surprise that Brooklyn has had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his fair share of girlfriends</a>. And most have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not said the kindest thing about him</a> after their respective breakups. While one could chalk this up to the fact that these women are heartbroken or jealous of Brooklyn's success or new romances, others would claim that there's a partner of behavior. Perhaps broken with Brooklyn's dedicated (albeit over the top) romance with Nicola.</p><p>At the age of 15, Brooklyn entered into his first public relationship with singer Tallia Storm. Even though Brooklyn claimed that he was not ever involved with Tallia, the Scottish singer publicly hit back at him in The Daily Mail saying, "We dislike each other. I couldn't be more angry. You dump me once three years ago, and now you dump me again! Why is he bringing it back up again? It's exhausting."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Brooklyn Beckham's Fiancée Nicola Peltz Was In Avatar &amp;amp; 9 More Fun Facts About Her</a></span></p><p>While this could've just been a one-off experience, Brooklyn's next girlfriend, acclaimed actor Chloe Grace Moretz, echoed similar things about Posh Spice's son but in a very different way. In an interview with The Times, Chloe said she "wants nothing to be said" of her past with Brooklyn after their on-and-off 4-year-long relationship. Although, during their relationship, she said that Brooklyn was "as beautiful" as he said he was.</p><p>During Brooklyn and Chloe's on-and-off-again relationship, the young photographer and model started dating a personal trainer named Afton McKeith-Magaziner. According to The Daily Star, none of her family liked Brooklyn and they were glad when the two called it quits. When that happened, Afton told The Daily Star that she was "better off without him". Brooklyn then blocked Afton on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lexy-panterra-and-hanna-cross-had-the-harsh-things-to-say>Lexy Panterra And Hanna Cross Had The Harsh Things To Say</h2><p>During a women-filled break from his relationship with Chloe, Brooklyn was also involved with dancer Lexy Panterra. But shortly after the two met at Coachella, Lexy told the world just how "immature" Brooklyn truly is.</p><p>"We are not together anymore because of his immature ways and him not being a good friend. I don't want to say exactly why we split. I don't want to bash him," she told The Sun before commenting on his engagement to Nicola Peltz. "I was pretty shocked and confused when I heard he got engaged. It's not something anyone was expecting and, honestly, Brooklyn is not ready for that. He is very young and way too immature. I don't know why he falls in love every few minutes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Brooklyn Beckham Playfully Chokes Fiancée Nicola Peltz In Raunchy New Pics</a></span></p><p>After his official break-up with Chloe, Brooklyn went on to date two more women before linking up with Nicola. One of them was Victoria and David's favorite, model Hanna Cross. But according to The Sun, their relationship crumbled when they went on a trip together to attend the Cannes Film Festival. Sources close to them claimed that Brooklyn got insanely jealous of the male attention that Hanna received and that she wasn't comfortable with his wealth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following their break-up, Hanna wrote a song about Brooklyn that included the line, "In 2020, the Mirror reported that Cross penned a song directed at Becks, singing, "You broke my heart and said let's be friends, but I never heard from you again and that's kind of mean."</p><p>While it's easy to judge Brooklyn, a few of these women, including Hanna Cross, have been accused of having "toxic" behavior of their own, according to Nicki Swift. Two things appear to be true at once, Brooklyn appears to have lived quite a life as a playboy while simultaneously some less than stellar women. However, given his track record, it seems as though Brooklyn has a lot of growing up to do in the romance department. Let's hope he has begun to sort all that out in his current relationship.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Brooklyn Beckham’s 21st Birthday Was Full of Surprises..
