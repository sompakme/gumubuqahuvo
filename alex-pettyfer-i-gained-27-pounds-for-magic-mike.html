Too hard.</p><p>In the August issue of <a href=#>Men's Health UK</a>, the 22-year-old actor reveals he went overboard after being asked to "put on a bit of weight" for his role as a newbie stripper. "I started off at 169 lbs. and went up to 196 lbs. They told me I was too big, so in the end I had to take it back down to 185 lbs."</p><p>Sticking to a diet and exercise routine wasn't easy, Pettyfer recalls. "It was hard, particularly at the start, and I still remember not wanting to be in the gym. That's why I don't want to train at the moment."</p><p>Instead, the British actor — who is currently engaged to <strong>Elvis Presley</strong>'s granddaughter, <strong>Riley</strong> <strong>Keough</strong>, 23 — is focused on furthering his film career. "I'm very ambitious. I live in reality but I have dreams I want to fulfill. I want to be a director, and I've already started my own production company. But I also have a measure of success that I keep to myself. It's something very personal to me."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Calling his father "one of my biggest heroes," Pettyfer hopes to have a career similar to <strong>Paul Newman</strong>'s. "I know a lot of people say that, but I love that he's a great role model and a humanitarian. I admire people who don't necessarily want to change the world, but try to make it a better environment."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaapJWterGx062wn52iYrZus8CipZ6cXWeEbrzOrqWdq12bvLN5zJqeoptdorassYxrZ2pqY2x8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
