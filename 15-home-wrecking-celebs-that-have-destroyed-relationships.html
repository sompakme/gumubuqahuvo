And we love it. It’s like these celebs we adore and revere are sitting on some type of pedestal. We don’t want to wish them ill, but sometimes it makes them seem more human if they’re brought down a peg or two. It’s all their own doing too, so there aren’t going to be many sympathizers when it happens. And it has happened, quite a lot, to a lot of celebs over the years. Various bouts of controversy seem to follow some celebs around. They may have upset a co-star, or said some things that&nbsp;angered a lot of people. Or they may have done some things that decent straight-laced individuals&nbsp;would probably deem to be truly abhorrent acts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To bulldoze in and wreck another person’s relationship is something that’s just a big no-no. I know it takes two to tango, and both of the individuals involved are at fault. But for some, the so-called act of home-wrecking seems to be common practice; it happens again and again. Marriages have been wrecked, families have been torn apart, and on occasions, children have been involved. It’s never a pretty situation. It might surprise some of you when you see some of the names on this list. But theses 15 have all destroyed relationships and have become home-wreckers. These are 15 home-wrecking celebs that have ruined relationships.</p><h2 id=tori-spelling><strong>Tori Spelling</strong></h2><p>Actress, TV personality, and socialite&nbsp;<a href=#>Tori Spelling</a>, has been rather quiet as of late. Perhaps that’s because she’s made a conscious effort to keep herself to herself, after a few wild years filled with scandals and infidelities. If Tori felt her relationship woes couldn’t get any worse, she was horribly mistaken.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here it goes; keep up if you can. In 2004, Tori was married to Charlie Shanian. Actor <a href=#>Dean McDermott</a> was married to actress Mary Jo Eustace. Tori and Dean met on the set of the TV movie Mind Over Murder. <strong>They seemed to forget they were married to other people, and became infatuated with each other right away.</strong> The very night they met they had an affair. They had seriously fallen for each other. Their other halves found out, they both got divorced, and they were then free to get hitched, which they did as soon as possible. That’s two relationships destroyed. In terms of their married life, everything seemed to be smelling like roses. They had kids, and were happily married for seven years. Well, Tori was happily married, but then things changed in 2013. It was discovered that Dean had had an affair with Emily Goodhand, a revelation that brought Tori’s world crashing down. Amazingly, they’re still together. Dean vowed to do whatever he could to mend their relationship, and they’re still husband and wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlie-sheen><strong>Charlie Sheen</strong></h2><p>Have you ever watched Two and a Half Men? That hit sitcom was basically <a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> playing himself, but even that was dialled down a notch. He’s tried to live the conventional life, settling down, getting married and what have you. But <strong>being loyal to his partner is not something he’s familiar with</strong>, and so consequently, pretty much every relationship he’s had has ended in disaster, including his marriages. <strong>His infidelity has ruined a number of relationships with women, and his kids too</strong>. In 2003, Charlie married <a href=#>Denise Richards</a>. Whilst she was pregnant with their second child, rumors and allegations surfaced that Charlie had been unfaithful. That caused Denise to walk while she was seven months pregnant. Charlie gave marriage a second go, but again messed it up. He was caught a number of times paying escorts. He even reportedly slept with these escorts in his and his wife’s marital bed. Understandably, that marriage went to pot, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kristen-stewart><strong>Kristen Stewart</strong></h2><p>Here’s another person who’s ruined one of the best things that’s happened to her – her relationship with Twilight co-star, <a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a>. Those are her words, not mine. It was a massive scandal when everyone came to know what Kristen had been doing while out on set. And there was no way she could deny it either, because of the photographic evidence. In 2012, while filming Snow White And The Huntsman, <a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a> was photographed getting cozy with her director, <a href=#>Rupert Sanders</a>. When I say getting cozy, I mean full on making out. Kristen was with Robert at the time, and there was a huge fallout when everything came to light. <strong>Rupert though, was married to Liberty Ross, and they had two kids together.</strong> To make things even more messed up, Ross played Stewart’s mom in that movie, and their kids were involved too. Those are the messed-up relationships we know about. Then there are the rumors. Kristen’s rumored to have dated Alicia Cargile, is rumored to have cheated on her for a French singer named Soko, and then cheated on Soko with Alicia again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> is without doubt the biggest socialite on the planet. She’s lived her life in front of the cameras over the last decade, and the paparazzi have a field day when she’s out and about. People are constantly gagging for any bit of juicy info about Kim, and the reality TV star has provided plenty over the years.</p><p>Her relationship with <a href=#>Kanye West</a> was seriously massive news. Those who watched her reality TV show saw it gradually materialize. Kanye didn’t hold back in saying that he’d been pursing Kim for a long time. The two were friends for many years before romance developed.<strong> They were supposedly just friends.</strong> But model <a href=#>Amber Rose</a>, who was dating Kanye before Kim, seems to think differently. <strong>She said that Kanye was having an affair with Kim while he was still seeing her.</strong> Kim was cheating too, and was with <a href=#>Reggie Bush</a> at the time. If this is true, this means that her failed marriage to <a href=#>Kris Humphries</a> really was a sham. Kris himself has said that he knew Kim was being unfaithful to him, and that’s before their separation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie><strong>Angelina Jolie</strong></h2><p>Here’s another actress who many people believe has a squeaky-clean image. She may be a seriously influential figure when it comes down to a lot of things, but when it comes to relationships, she hasn’t had the success that she would have wanted. Perhaps that’s because she’s been unfaithful, and her ruined relationships have been largely her doing.</p><p>It seems like such a long time ago now, but <a href=#>Angelina</a> was once in a relationship with a woman. She’s admitted she was bis*xual, and was in a relationship with model-actress, Jenny Shimizu. <strong>But while she was dating Jenny, someone Angelina claimed she loved and wanted to marry, she was romantically involved with several other people.</strong> Then <a href=#>Billy Bob Thornton</a> came along. When they met on the set of a film, they fell for each other right away. But Billy was engaged to <a href=#>Laura Dern</a>, and it’s rumored that Angelina was dating <a href=#>Timothy Hutton</a> at the time. There are two relationships ruined. Then there’s that massive scandal – well, the media made it a scandal anyway. She had fallen in love with Brad Pitt, while he was married to <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>. It’s thought she was the reason for the couple’s split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alicia-keys><strong>Alicia Keys</strong></h2><p>In 2008, singer and songwriter, <a href=#>Alicia Keys</a> began dating rapper <a href=#>Swizz Beatz</a>. It caused a huge stink at the time, not really from people in any of their camps. But Swizz Beatz’s wife certainly wasn’t happy. Yes, you read that correctly, he was married when he began dating Alicia Keys. This is where things got really catty.<strong> They were in the process of getting divorced when it became public that Keys and Beatz were dating.</strong> But according to Beatz’s wife at the time, Mashonda, Alicia used her feminine wiles to entice Beatz to cheat, and they were having an affair whilst she and her hubby were happily married. Mashonda and Beatz also had a son together. Mashonda’s actually been pretty vocal in referring to Alicia Keys as a home-wrecker. She’s also come out with various other nasty comments over the years. Here’s a snippet from one of her Twitter rants in 2009: “You know the role you played and you know how you contributed to the ending of my marriage. You know that I asked you to step back and let me handle my family issues. Issues that you helped to create… As a woman, I expected so much more from you. I never had intentions on reaching out to you this way but after reading your tweets tonight, and the constant disregard, you left me no choice.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lamar-odom><strong>Lamar Odom</strong></h2><p>And the curse of the Kardashians strikes again! Actually, that’s a tad unfair, because Lamar’s fall from grace wasn’t down to anyone but himself. But him being on the reality show certainly had a part to play.</p><p>After a whirlwind romance, <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian </a>and <a href=#>Lamar Odom</a> got married. Their marriage shocked a lot of people, because they got hitched a month after meeting. The family wasn’t pleased, but it didn’t take long for them to embrace the decision, welcome Lamar into the family, and into the world of reality TV. He became a much-loved part of the show. But four years later, things took a turn for the worse. He started using alcohol and drugs, was arrested numerous times, and was in a really dark place.<strong> Lamar also reportedly cheated on Khloe numerous times when he was in this bad state</strong>, and that included him visiting brothels, which is where he was discovered unconscious and almost lost his life due to the poisonous concoction of&nbsp;alcohol and drugs he’d consumed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tiger-woods><strong>Tiger Woods</strong></h2><p>Here’s another athlete, a superstar athlete who had a pretty remarkable fall from grace. Golfer <a href=#>Tiger Woods</a> had been hiding a big secret from his wife and family; that he was a s*x addict.&nbsp;This essentially means that he could never get enough, and he couldn’t fulfil all of his needs and desires at home, so he had to go elsewhere.</p><p>2009 is the year that things began to go wrong for Tiger. Allegations were published that Tiger was having an extramarital affair. Two days later he had a car crash. Things were unravelling fast for Tiger. A few days after that, new evidence came to light, and Tiger admitted transgressions. <strong>Dozens of women came forward and said that they’d had affairs with Tiger. The disgraced golfer admitted everything in the following weeks. Apparently, he slept with up to 120 women.</strong> After the inevitable divorce, Tiger began a relationship with skier <a href=#>Lindsey Vonn</a>. They eventually split, and it was rumored that this was because he’d had an affair with a woman and ex-golfing WAG, Amanda Boyd.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=claire-danes><strong>Claire Danes</strong></h2><p>Actress <a href=#>Claire Danes</a> might seem like she’s a strait-laced individual, but she lost her squeaky-clean image a long time ago. Back in the early 2000s, she was at the center of a massive cheating scandal. The scandal was huge news at the time, and received a ton of publicity.</p><p>In 1997, <a href=#>Winona Ryder</a> introduced her to Australian singer, Ben Lee, who was at her birthday party. They hit it off right away. But six years later, their relationship ended in tumultuous fashion. It’s rumored that she had an affair with her former Princess Mononoke and Stage Beauty co-star <a href=#>Billy Crudup</a>.<strong> No sooner had she broken things off with Ben, she started officially dating Billy. As if that wasn’t bad enough, another relationship was ruined.</strong> Billy was with <a href=#>Mary-Louise Parker</a> at the time, who was pregnant with their kid. But he just upped and left, something that made Billy and Claire the most hated duo in Hollywood at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eddie-cibrian><strong>Eddie Cibrian</strong></h2><p>Actor <a href=#>Eddie Cibrian</a> is someone who can only be described as a serial cheater. He’s someone who ruins relationships for fun, and I’m talking about big, long-term relationships. When Eddie was married to <a href=#>Brandi Glanville</a>, he cheated on her with the model <a href=#>LeAnn Rimes</a>. LeAnn is his current wife, but that’s not going to matter to Brandi. It’s certainly not going to make her feel better about things. Eddie really didn’t treat her well. <strong>He didn’t only cheat on his wife his now-wife; he cheated on her multiple times.</strong><a href=#>Scheana Marie Shay</a>, star of Vanderpump Rules, was another one of his conquests. According to Shay, he lied about being married at the start of their relationship. When Shay found out, she was furious. Down the line, Eddie pursued Shay again. This was at the time he was also having an affair with LeAnn Rimes. People eventually found out about Eddie and LeAnn, and so they went public, and once his divorce with Brandi was finalized, they got married.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-timberlake><strong>Justin Timberlake</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a> has simmered down a bit over the years. Married life has kept him grounded, and he seems to be enjoying family life. There haven’t really been any recent scandals in Justin’s life. He’s probably had enough of them for a lifetime, although the cheating scandals were no one’s fault but his own. His nickname amongst those in the music industry and Hollywood scene was “Trouser Snake.” I shouldn’t need to explain what that’s referring too. Justin started a relationship with his now-wife, <a href=#>Jessica Biel</a>, in 2009. At the same time, there were pretty strong rumors that he was seeing singing sensation, <a href=#>Rihanna</a>. Rihanna was with someone at the time, and this destroyed their relationship. It destroyed Justin’s relationship with Biel at the time too when she found out, but things have obviously been rectified. <strong>Sources revealed that he was telling people his relationship with Biel was over, and he went wild, and reportedly hooked up with multiple women</strong>, including actress, <a href=#>Olivia Munn</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jesse-james><strong>Jesse James</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jesse James </a>is an American TV personality and a motorcycle enthusiast. He’s got that stereotypical biker persona about him: covered in tats, wears leathers, and is a bit of a bad boy. Well, he’s certainly a bad boy. He has acquired a dodgy reputation, amongst the women in the celebrity world, anyway. Jesse’s someone who’s continuously been unfaithful to those he’s dated over the years. At the 2010 Academy Awards, Jesse’s wife at the time, <a href=#>Sandra Bullock</a> couldn’t stop singing his praises during her acceptance speech. <strong>A matter of days later, the world found out that he’d had multiple affairs while she’d been away filming. He admitted his wrongdoings and issued an apology, but Bullock wasn’t sticking around.</strong> He moved on to tattoo artist, <a href=#>Kat Von D</a>, and this relationship wasn’t much better. It was an on-again off-again relationship. They got engaged, but split for good instead of walking down the aisle. <strong>Apparently, Jesse had cheated on Kat with up to 19 women!</strong> He’s now married to a new woman, who so far seems to have made an honest man out of him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-brown><strong>Chris Brown</strong></h2><p>We all know that <a href=#>Chris Brown</a> has had his fair share of problems. He’s struggled with the fame, with all of the media attention, and has self-destructed, although that’s no excuse for what he’s done. There’s been numerous legal issues that have blighted his career to date, and his stint in rehab doesn’t seem to have had the desired effect. Some of these issues he’s been struggling with are jealousy issues. There’s no reason for it, none at all, but it’s been said that it’s part of the reason why he’s been violent to his girlfriends. It’s also why he’s dated multiple women, including two at the same time.<strong> In 2013, he actually confessed in an interview, that he was dating Rihanna and a woman named Karrueche Tran.</strong> He and Rihanna eventually split for good, so he turned all of his attention to Tran, or that’s what everyone thought. <strong>He was actually seeing another woman, a model named Nia, at the same time, and got her pregnant while he was supposedly in a committed relationship with Tran.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sienna-miller><strong>Sienna Miller</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Sienna Miller</a> is one of the hottest actresses on the planet. She’s gorgeous, and has that butter wouldn’t melt look, so it may surprise a lot of you that she’s actually had a part to play in ruining plenty of relationships. She’s used her feminine wiles to get with plenty of men, and it’s made for one messed up, checkered dating history.</p><p>One thing a lot of people may know about Sienna, is that she herself got cheated on when she was with <a href=#>Jude Law</a>. <strong>He cheated on her with the nanny, but Miller cheated too.</strong> She’s admitted hooking up with fellow British actor <a href=#>Daniel Craig</a>. Understandably, the Miller and Law relationship was doomed. When they split, Miller began seeing <a href=#>Balthazar Getty</a>, who was married at the time, and amazingly, still is. Then it was Tom Sturridge. They started a family together, but split when she began filming for the movie, Lost City Of Z. <strong>It’s rumored she was having an affair with the producer of that movie, <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=arnold-schwarzenegger><strong>Arnold </strong><strong>Schwarzenegger</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>’s the king of pretty much whatever he turns his attention to. Whatever he does, he makes a success of it and climbs to the top. He’s revered like a saint by those into bodybuilding, and by those in the acting profession, not forgetting his political allies. But he’s no king when it comes to relationships, and he’s certainly no saint. Everyone thought he was when he was in a committed relationship to <a href=#>Maria Shriver</a>. But in 2011, news broke that would shatter the Schwarzenegger’s perfect world. It came out that he’d had a long-term affair with his housekeeper, and that he’d fathered a child by her. Schwarzenegger also admitted he’d had a “hot affair” with an actress named <a href=#>Brigitte Nielsen</a>. He revealed all in his memoir. Apparently, he was with Shriver at the time, but they weren’t married. The affair made him realize how much he wanted to be with Shriver. Lucky her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2dvK6xjLCpnpubnruoecKeo56ao2LBqa3TZp%2BarpVisaa%2F06umsp2UYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
