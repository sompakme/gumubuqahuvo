But now, contestant Ashley is hoping to get help from viewers to pay offer her student loans after her six-figure debt was exposed on a recent episode.</p><p>Ashley reached out to her followers on Instagram on Sunday, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seeking assistance to alleviate her $100,000 student debt</a>. In her first story slide, Ashley appeared seated on a couch with a cheerful expression, accompanied by a text overlay that asked, "Wanna help me pay back my student loan debt?"</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot-2024-06-03-at-12-35-16-pm.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="’90 Day Fiance’ Star Deavan Clegg Gives Rare Update On Toddler’s Cancer Battle">’90 Day Fiance’ Star Deavan Clegg Gives Rare Update On Toddler’s Cancer Battle</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>She also gave fans insight into her new fiancé while offering an update on her son's health.</p><h2 id=ashley-begged-her-followers-to-use-her-spiritual-services>Ashley Begged Her Followers To Use Her Spiritual Services</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following slide showed Ashley striking a pose on a rugged cliff overlooking the ocean. In this post, she encouraged her fans to book one of her Cameo videos, for which she charges $40 each.</p><p>The final slide directed her supporters to visit her website, Star Seed Shadows, where she promotes her services as a "spiritual and business development mentor and healer."</p><p>"Spiritual work is everywhere now and I love it so much. This is coming from a girl who used to hide her tarot cards,” she said in another slide.</p><p>Ashley has been open about her spiritual work on 90 Day, and explaining how she identifies as a witch, a label that even her foreign-born husband has a hard time wrapping his head around. The reality star’s plea for fans to use her services to help generate more income comes after she discussed her debt on the T.V.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-rsquo-s-student-debt-was-exposed-during-last-episode>Ashley’s Student Debt Was Exposed During Last Episode</h2><p>In a recent meeting with a lawyer to discuss a post-nuptial agreement with her husband, Manuel Velez Rojas, Ashley revealed her debt burden.</p><p>Manuel was astonished to discover his wife’s financial difficulties and was seemingly unaware of how high her debt was. In a confessional, he admitted, "Before coming to the lawyer, I was annoyed, but once I found out about Ashley’s debt, I was really in shock."</p><p>He further remarked, "I knew she was really bad at managing money, but this is another level."</p><p>90 Day Fiance cast members <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly earn about $1,000 to $1,500 per episode</a>, with those appearing on a full season potentially making between $14,000 and $18,000.
