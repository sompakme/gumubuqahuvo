I have 300 drafts, so I hope you guys are ready.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Courtesy-of-Allison-Rochell-Instagram01.jpg><p>She captioned the post: “To the people seeing me rubbing my stomach in public … does it make sense now??”</p><p>Kuch and Rochell met in 2014 when they were sophomores in college. They got engaged in July 2020 and eloped that December before having a second wedding in April 2021.</p><p>Although Kuch has frequently documented <a href=#>her relationship with Rochell</a> since stepping into the spotlight, she hinted earlier this year that she didn’t want to show the world everything.</p><p>“We have a very strong relationship, we’ve been together eight years and I’m not scared to share any part of that,” she said on the <a href=# rel=noopener>“Real Pod With Victoria Garrick”</a> in February. “But I’ve learned that I like the privacy of our relationship to a certain extent, as well as other parts of my life that are private, like family and our children one day. There’s a level of things I’m willing to share.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the days leading up to her baby girl’s arrival, Kuch reflected on her pregnancy journey. “These could be my last moments just being alone for a long time,” she said in an Instagram video taken the day before her C-section. “I’m really excited to become a mom. It doesn’t sound real. It’s very surreal that I’m gonna become a mom, but I’m so excited to see my daughter and see what she looks like and just have a little best friend and spoil the crap out of her.”</p><p>She concluded: “I’m having a baby tomorrow. I cannot believe those words are coming out of my mouth.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaapJyewLC6jKSsnKBdnLa3sdJmmaKqpJ16uLHLnKamnaNifrTAjJuYm7FdrLa1tIyhrKyakaOxbrXSmpicZaKksKmxy6Vm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
