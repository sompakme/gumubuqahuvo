After Ramirez left the show in 2016, <a href=#>not much was heard from them until the SATC reboot And Just Like That...</a> Though Ramirez played a largely hated side character, the role was a breakthrough in many ways.</p><p>And, Sara's gig as Che Diaz meant a revival of interest in their personal life, something they haven't been too keen to share about. Since Sara split from Ryan DeBolt in 2021, not much has been heard about their dating life. It turns out there might be a simple explanation for why‚Äîand how‚ÄîRamirez keeps things quiet.</p><h2 id=sara-ramirez-and-ryan-debolt-split-before-their-2021-divorce>Sara Ramirez And Ryan DeBolt Split Before Their 2021 Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Greys-Anatomy-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though <a href=#>Sara Ramirez and now ex-husband Ryan DeBolt announced their divorce</a> in 2021, they also hinted that they had already been separated for a while by the time the divorce was finalized.</p><p>Fans might have thought that Grey's Anatomy was something of a wakeup call for Ramirez, who didn't publicly come out until 2016. Yet Sara had come out to friends ages before, and it's only assumed that Ryan DeBolt knew of his partner's orientation long before they were married.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why 'Grey's Anatomy' Fans Hold A Grudge Against Sara Ramirez</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Grey's Anatomy may have helped Sara come out more publicly</a> since Callie was such a beloved LGBTQ+ icon, but it wasn't an epic realization that broke Sara's marriage. Rather, they and Ryan DeBolt grew apart, and fortunately have remained friends since their split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sara-and-ryan-both-dated-other-people-but-quietly>Sara And Ryan Both Dated Other People (But Quietly)</h2><p>Sara Ramirez explained that both they and their former partner had begun seeing other people before their divorce was finalized. To hear Ramirez tell it, it may have been a year or more that the two spent apart before ultimately obtaining a legal divorce.</p><p>Because they didn't tell anyone‚Äîexcept close family and friends, presumably‚Äîthat they had separated, the media likely didn't know to be on the lookout for Ryan or Sara stepping out with anyone else.</p><h3 id=who-is-ryan-debolt-dating-now>Who Is Ryan DeBolt Dating Now?</h3><p>Unfortunately for fans, there's no hint as to who Ryan DeBolt might be dating post-split from Sara. In fact, Ryan DeBolt doesn't seem to have much of an online presence; top results for his name include a fan page dedicated to Sara Ramirez on Instagram, a listing for a musician of the same name, and articles that still label him as Sara's husband.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most sources say that Ryan is a "businessman," but it's unclear where he might work or whether he's involved in Hollywood. It's also not apparent whether Ryan has his own financial success separate from Sara's; various sources suggest he's worth about $4.5 million, but many sites still list him as Sara's partner.</p><h2 id=who-is-sara-ramirez-dating-now>Who Is Sara Ramirez Dating Now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sara-ramirez-on-a-red-carpet-in-2007.jpg><p>Frustratingly for fans, Sara Ramirez hasn't shared much about their relationship status post-Ryan DeBolt. However, Sara did drop a single post about a certain someone in January 2023, with a few tags since then, on Instagram.</p><p>Taking a deeper dive into Ramirez's social media history, it's clear that they've been seeing someone special for a while.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a long caption on an image where they tagged Sawyer DeVuyst, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sara began by saying</a>, "The thing about finding the right one for me is knowing without a doubt that their heart and mind are as beautiful as they are."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Sara Ramirez Ruin Any Chance At Getting Back In Shonda Rhimes' Good Graces (And Onto Grey's Anatomy?)</a></span></p><p>Praising Sawyer's "maturity, strength, integrity, kindness, generosity, self awareness," Ramirez finished off their post by writing, "I love you, Sawyer. To the moon and back. Thank you for loving me so fully, so truly and so wholeheartedly. ‚ô•Ô∏èü•∞"</p><p>After that, Sara didn't openly gush about their new partner (or perhaps not-so-new partner), but it seems evident that the two are still together, especially because Sawyer often makes visible appearances in the background of his partner's posts, as well as in the tags.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=who-is-sara-ramirez-39-s-boyfriend>Who Is Sara Ramirez's Boyfriend?</h3><p>Sara Ramirez's partner is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sawyer DeVuyst, a model, actor, and visual artist</a>. It's unclear how the two met, but it may have been due to Sara's deeper involvement in the LGBTQ+ community; Sawyer is a transgender man who often <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posts about his journey, his work, and his partner</a>.</p><p>In one Instagram post, Sawyer wrote about going camping and tubing with Sara, as well as shared snapshots both taken by and featuring Sara. Ramirez often comments on their partner's social media, with heart emojis and other supportive comments going back to at least 2020 on Instagram.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Sara Ramirez Is Reminding People They‚Äôre Not Che Diaz</a></span></p><p>It's possible that after their split from Ryan DeBolt, Sara connected with Sawyer and has been dating him since. Either way, it would seem that Ramirez has their former partner's blessing, and equally supports Ryan finding someone special, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Sara Ramirez hasn't kept their relationship totally hush-hush, and it only took a minimal amount of sleuthing to find their partner, the simple explanation for why the relationship isn't making headlines is likely because Sawyer is nowhere near as famous as Sara.</p><p>Plus, there's nothing dramatic or exciting to report, and the two don't seem to have made any red carpet appearances together (yet).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuv8CrmGaqkaK2s7HZZpuarJmjtG66zrBkmp6kmr9usMivpqublWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
