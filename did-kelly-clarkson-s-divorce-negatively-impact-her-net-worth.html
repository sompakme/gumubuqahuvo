She admitted that more often than not she pretended publicly things were fine, when in reality, things were messier than the media was aware of.</p><p>The divorce, which was announced in 2020, was finalized in March 2022. At that time, Kelly was awarded primary custody. However, she also had to pay a hefty amount of money to her ex, Brandon Blackstock. Outside of a lump sum of $1.3 million, Kelly has to pay over $45,000 per month in child support and has to pay spousal support to the tune of $115,000 per month until January 2024.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Kelly has a hefty net worth, spending this amount monthly does put a dent into Kelly's fortune. Fortunately for Kelly, her spousal support payments will be coming to an end soon, so that will stop the massive monthly hemorrhaging she has grown accustomed to for the last couple of years.</p><p>Kelly also has an opportunity to make up that net worth, given that 'The Kelly Clarkson Show' which was recently moved from Los Angeles to New York City, has been renewed through 2025. But knowing Kelly, that is not all she has up her sleeves professionally, and she will likely be growing her net worth for years to come.</p><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-owes-spousal-support-to-brandon-blackstock>Kelly Clarkson Owes Spousal Support To Brandon Blackstock</h2><h3 id=total-spousal-support-owed-115-000-per-month>Total Spousal Support Owed: $115,000 Per Month</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar50300226-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Kelly Clarkson's salary from The Voice</a> is very high, but she has to pay her ex-husband a lot of money each month.</p><p>While <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kelly has a $45 million net worth</a>, her divorce has definitely meant spending some serious cash.
