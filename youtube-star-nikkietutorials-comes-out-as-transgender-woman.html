I am me. We don’t need labels. If we are going to put a label on it, yes, I am transgender, but at the end of the day, I am me. And at the end of the day you are you.”</p><p>Known for her popular makeup tutorials, Nikkie shared that everyone deserves to be themselves and tell their own story.</p><p>“You can be you,” she said. “You are in charge of how you want to live your life. I am here to openly share that I am transgender, and with this message, I want to inspire little Nikkies around the world, who feel insecure, who feel out of place, who are misunderstood. I hope by me standing up and being free, that it inspired others to do the same.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/YouTube-Star-NikkiTutorials-Comes-Out-Transgender-Woman-02.jpg><p>She also talked about her supportive mother, who she said she is “most thankful for” and has been there for her “since day one.”</p><p>Nikkie, who <a href=#>got engaged in Italy</a> in August to her boyfriend <strong>Dylan Drossaers</strong>, gave her man a shout-out during the emotional video.</p><p>“I’ve never met anyone like him.
