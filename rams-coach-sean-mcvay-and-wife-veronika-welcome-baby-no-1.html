I’m not going to miss a game,” Sean, 37, said during a press conference on October 16, joking, “<a href=#>My son knows better</a> than to come during a game. That’s not gonna be anything that we have to worry about.”</p><p>Sean’s little one proved him right this week when he was born days ahead of the Rams’ Sunday, October 29, game against the Dallas Cowboys in Texas.</p><p>“On an off day too. Legendary,” <a href=#>the Rams teased of Jordan’s arrival via Instagram</a> on Wednesday, sharing a onesie with McVay written on the back. “Congratulations, Coach + Veronika!”</p><p>Sean — <a href=#>who married Veronika in June 2022</a> — spoke about his newborn during the team’s Wednesday press conference, sharing that Jordan’s middle name is in honor of Sean’s late grandfather John McVay. (John coached the New York Giants from 1976 to 1978 and later became an executive for the San Francisco 49ers. He died in October 2022 at the age of 91.)</p><p>“His original due date was — kinda eerie how things work out — his original due date was when my grandfather passed a year ago on the 31st,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Sean explained</a>. “Which is just pretty special and if you don’t believe in a higher power there’s certain things that occur that man, you just realize there’s something special going on.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>Super Bowl-winning coach</a> continued: “I come from a family of faith, I’m a man of faith and so thought that was really … you know the influence that you guys know my grandfather had on me, but also our family, he had a special relationship with Veronika as well.”</p><p>Sean concluded by saying he thought it was “appropriate” to give his son the middle name so his grandfather’s “legacy lives on” in another way. “I know he’s looking down smiling with what occurred yesterday,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGarmZ2oeqS7wJyfZquVlrtuucKvmLJlkaOxbsPIn5xmrpWnvK%2B1yppksJ2cmLyusYybmJuxXaO8bn2O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
