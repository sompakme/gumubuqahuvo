The films all boast an impressive cast of characters with some very well-known actors attached to them, like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson. The main three leads were played by Hollywood's young elite at the time, including Liam Hemsworth, who was pretty new to Hollywood at the time, Josh Hutcherson, who already had a career in voice acting and is known for his lead role in Zathura, and Jennifer Lawrence with X-Men: First Class under her belt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while starring in action movies does come with the pressure of being in peak physical condition, sometimes the advice given to the actors isn't in their best interest, especially when it involves telling an already slim or petite person to lose more weight just to play a part in a film.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence-felt-pressure-to-lose-weight>Jennifer Lawrence Felt Pressure To Lose Weight</h2><p>Lawrence was a relatively new, unknown actress when the role of Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games was presented to her. She had just graced the big screen with her presence in X-Men: First Class as a young Mystique, a character that is essentially known for leaving very little of her body to the imagination.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Reasons Why Jennifer Lawrence Took A Break From Hollywood">The Reasons Why Jennifer Lawrence Took A Break From Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Jennifer Lawrence admits that she <a href=#>has positive memories of her time as Katniss Everdeen</a>, but there is some advice that was given to her in the early days of her career that stuck with her forever, and it's advice that she immediately rejected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She recalls one of the biggest questions that kept coming her way was surrounding how much weight she was going to lose to portray Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games franchise, something she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admits affected her craft at the time</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar52049771.jpg><p>Lawrence goes on to say "I didn't know how to fix it. I was scrambling, trying to fix it by saying yes to this movie and then trying to counteract it with that movie.
