“I went to see [producer Mark Burnett] at a restaurant [in a] hotel called Shutters at the beginning, before the pilot, and he said, ‘We’re looking for a real a-hole and you’re it,’” O’Leary exclusively told Us Weekly on Monday, September 25, while promoting Shark Tank’s milestone 15th season — which premieres on Friday, September 29."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He joked: “I’ve won the <a href=#>Most Villainous Guy on TV</a> [award] twice. I’m so proud of that. Sure, we’ve won a few <a href=#>Emmys</a>, but winning the award as the Most Hated Man, that’s hard to do. I’m so proud of it.”</p><p>Before Shark Tank’s premiere in 2009, he and costar <a href=#><strong>Robert Herjavec</strong></a> worked together on the show’s U.K. counterpart, Dragon’s Den. Just like O’Leary, Herjavec, 61, was contacted by Burnett, 63, to join the series — only on much shorter notice.</p><p>“They were already starting to shoot and they had somebody else that was going to be me — somebody who was actually pretty famous, we can’t say — and then it didn’t work out,” the <a href=#>Canadian businessman</a> explained to Us. “So, Mark called me. I was actually skiing, and he said, ‘We’re doing this show called Shark Tank with Kevin. You should come and do it.’ And I said, ‘Great. Where do you shoot?’ He said, ‘California. Can you be here by tomorrow?’ And we got a visa in 24 hours. It was incredible.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kevin-O-Leary-Says-He-Was-Cast-on-Shark-Tank-For-Being-an-A-Hole-1.jpg><p>Despite his previous experience on Dragon’s Den, Herjavec thought Shark Tank would be a “hard concept to get off the ground” for American audiences. “In the first season, I remember we had dinner and we were all like, ‘Wow, that was great. We’ll never see you again,’” she shared.</p><p>O’Leary agreed, adding, “The premise was for reality TV, if you got five years, that was a huge run. And for the first few years it struggled, but then it captured the imagination of everybody that had inspiration to be an entrepreneur in America, and that’s everybody.”</p><p>Now 15 seasons in, the show’s success “surprised everybody involved in it,” according to O’Leary. “It became a family show at the same time, it went geometric in its fourth year and we’ve never looked back,” he added.</p><p>The pair have grown close with their fellow Sharks <a href=#><strong>Daymond John</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Barbara Corcoran</strong></a>, <strong>Mark Cuban</strong> and <strong>Lori Greiner</strong> over the years, so much so that they aren’t afraid to <a href=#>poke fun at each other</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kevin-O-Leary-Says-He-Was-Cast-on-Shark-Tank-For-Being-an-A-Hole-2.jpg><p>“We’ve been working together for 15 years and I will say this — and this just shows you how much we like each other — I buy [Barbara] a new broom every year so she can make it to California,” O’Leary quipped, to which Herjavec replied, “You’re so mean to her.”</p><p>O’Leary, for his part, stated that he’s “not mean at all,” before stating, “I think of her like my great-grandmother, very lovingly.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Shark Tank season 15 premieres on ABC Friday, September 29, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKerpmjerC4xJqpsmWZqHqxvs6um2asmJbBbr%2FHmqmkZaSWu6x5wpqqrWWYnrpuwM5mmZ5lkaN6onnHqKOeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
