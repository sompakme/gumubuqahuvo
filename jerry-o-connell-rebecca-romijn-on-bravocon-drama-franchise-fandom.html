Yes,” O’Connell, 48, enthusiastically told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>on Wednesday, September 19, when asked if he and Romijn, 49, would be interested in joining the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>. “</i>I’ll tell you, I <a href=#>really wanted to be a House Husband</a>. Like, I look at <a href=#><strong>Mauricio [Umansky</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a>’ husband] and<a href=#><strong> Ken Todd</strong> </a>[who’s married to <a href=#><strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong></a>] and <a href=#><strong>PK [Kemsley</strong></a>, who is coupled up with <a href=#><strong>Dorit Kemsley</strong></a>] and I wanna, like, hang out with those guys.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Would-Jerry-OConnell-Wife-Rebecca-Romijn-Join-RHOBH-0001.jpg><p class=p1>While the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Talk</a>&nbsp;</i>host — who emcees the&nbsp;<i>Real Love Boat&nbsp;</i>with Romijn — is <a href=#>eager to join the Bravo franchise</a>, his wife is more apprehensive.</p><p class=p1>“We’re such fans of the franchise [but] you know, the truth is probably not ‘cause I really would rather talk about them than be one of them,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Ugly Betty&nbsp;</i></a>alum joked to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>on Wednesday. “I feel like I would miss out on the gossip part of it. Or I guess, they all gossip when they’re on the show, but I don’t like fighting.”</p><p class=p1>The twosome — who <a href=#>share 13-year-old twins Dolly and Charlie</a> — have been fervent Bravo fans through the years, with O’Connell even moderating a panel at BravoCon 2022.</p><p class=p1>“<a href=#>Going to BravoCon this weekend</a> and seeing Lisa Rinna get booed … was a little scary,” O’Connell recalled to&nbsp;<i>Us</i>. “Like, that was 8,000 people booing somebody and Lisa handled it really well. And Lisa’s great on that show, you know.”</p><p class=p1>The Rinna Beauty founder, 59, received <a href=#>a mixed reaction from the convention crowd</a> when she took the stage at the “Thrills in Beverly Hills” cast panel on Friday, October 14,” alongside her&nbsp;<i>RHOBH&nbsp;</i>costars.</p><p class=p1>“They booed me. I loved it. It’s fabulous,” the&nbsp;<i>Veronica Mars&nbsp;</i>alum <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>shortly after the panel concluded.</a> “Well, I’d never been booed before. I kind of thought it was the greatest thing ever. It’s like being a wrestler. I loved it.”</p><p class=p1>O’Connell, for his part, even praised Rinna’s strength for <a href=#>handling the unexpected crowd reaction</a>. “If I got booed at Bravocon, I would leave the country,” he quipped. “I would be gone. I don’t know if I could handle it, but Lisa Rinna handles it really well.”</p><p class=p1>The CBS personalities, who <a href=#>both believe Rinna should return for season 13</a>, are also huge fans of the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Below Deck</a>&nbsp;</i>franchise. While O’Connell enjoyed meeting the crew members this past weekend, <a href=#>it was <strong>Andrea Denver</strong> who left him starstruck</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I have to say it was really exciting for me to meet <a href=#>Andrea Denver</a> of&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Winter House</i></a>&nbsp;fame,” the&nbsp;<i>Stand By Me&nbsp;</i>actor gushed to&nbsp;<i>Us</i>. “Rebecca is not <a href=#>a&nbsp;<i>Winter House</i>&nbsp;viewer</a> and I’m probably happy about that ‘cause I’m not sure that Rebecca would be with me if Rebecca met Andrea Denver.&nbsp;&nbsp;… He’s so hot.”</p><p class=p1>In addition to keeping up with all things Bravo, the married couple are helping a group of singles <a href=#>find love aboard the&nbsp;<i>Real Love Boat</i></a>, a reality TV series based on the classic sitcom of the same name.</p><p class=p1>“Helping singles find their perfect matches was like [a] dream job,” Romijn told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>of cohosting the CBS series. “Having to spend every waking moment next to your spouse is not always the easiest. I mean, I [loved it]! I keep saying it was like 97 percent amazing. There was [just] no separation.”</p><p class=p1>O’Connell added: “We also learned that on a cruise <a href=#>people can find love because time stands still</a>. Like, after doing the&nbsp;<i>Real Love Boat</i>, I totally get Jack and Rose [from&nbsp;<i>Titanic</i>]. …There’s no distraction.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>The Real Love Boat</i>&nbsp;airs on CBS on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnaKnxm67wqilp52coXqzscGempyZXae8rrXJp2Sopl2Xv6LCzpymp2WUp66urYyfqZqmk522tLGMn5innJ%2BifA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
