Shelton and Stefanie began dating the following year after their respective splits from <a href=#><strong>Miranda Lambert</strong></a> and Rossdale, 57. Last year, Shelton announced he would be <a href=#>exiting the NBC singing competition series</a> at the end of season 23.</p><p>“This show has changed my life in every way for the better and it will always feel like home to me,” the country star said in an October press release. “It’s been a hell of a ride over these 12 years of chair turns and I want to thank everyone at The Voice from NBC, every producer, the writers, musicians, crew and catering people, you are the best.”</p><p>The decision to leave his role on the show was one Shelton “really agonized” over, another insider told <a href=#>Us</a> at the time. “He was in two minds for a while because the show has given him so much — and certainly way more than just a financial perspective,” the source shared, adding that he has “loved mentoring these upcoming performers.”</p><p>Shelton bid farewell from The Voice following the <a href=#>May 23 finale</a>. Stefani, meanwhile, will return as a coach for season 24, which premieres on September 25, alongside <a href=#><strong>John Legend</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Niall Horan</strong></a> and first-time coach <a href=#><strong>Reba McEntire</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Blake-Shelton-Feels-Relief-to-Spend-More-Time-With-Gwen-Stefani-2.jpg><p>Two months before Shelton announced his The Voice exit, he revealed that his personal and professional <a href=#>priorities have changed</a> over the past few years. “Look, I love music and I love The Voice. I love all the cool things I get to do with my job, but those things all take a backseat now to Gwen and the kids and it’s just a new phase of my life,” he told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in August 2022.</p><p>The family of five made a rare public appearance at Shelton’s <a href=#>Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony</a> in May, as Stefani and her sons posed for red carpet pics with the “Nobody Like You” singer.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Shelton has also supported his stepson, Kingston, as he tries his hand at music. Last month, Stefani’s eldest <a href=#>performed a set</a> at Shelton’s Ole Red bar and music venue in Oklahoma. Shelton was seen hugging the teen after his performance in a clip shared via <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>For more on Shelton and Stefani, watch the video above and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoKlir62typ5krKCVocGwuoyfnJ6ko2K%2FprjInp1mr5mptW6z1p6lZqukmrOiushmmJ%2Bslad6t7vInJxmnaiewXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
