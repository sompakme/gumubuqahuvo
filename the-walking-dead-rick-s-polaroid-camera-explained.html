During the chilling season 8 premiere of The Walking Dead, Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) had to pull Rick (Andrew Lincoln) away from the Sanctuary as it was being infested by the walkers. However, it was not before Rick pulled out a Polaroid camera to take a snap of Negan’s home under attack.

There’s a very important point to the story of it,” <a href=#>showrunner <strong>Scott Gimple</strong> said</a>. “It’s not going to be each episode. I don’t want to break down the structure of the story, but I will say it is used as much as it should be.”</p><p>Not even Lincoln was informed on which time frame went with what when filming!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Scott Gimple probably is a man who keeps his cards extremely close to his chest and there were several conversations where I was saying, ‘I kind of need to know who I’m talking to,’ or ‘Is this reality?’ And he was cagey,” the actor, 44, revealed. “And rightly so, because it’s quite exciting. It feels like perhaps there are these variations in a future that’s being offered up perhaps. But I think that the idea is that they are intended to be abstract.”</p><p>The Walking Dead airs on AMC Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2srq23yKeeZpyVlrFuvsicoqxloKS5or7Ooptmm5GisrOtjJ6vqaSRnrumsI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
