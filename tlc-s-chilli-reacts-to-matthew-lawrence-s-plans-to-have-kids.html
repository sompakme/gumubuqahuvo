I gotta be married for sure&nbsp;—&nbsp;and I’m not married, yet!”</p><p class=p1>Chilli — who shares son Tron, 25, with ex <strong>Dallas Austin</strong> — <a href=#>has been dating the&nbsp;<i>Boy Meets World&nbsp;</i>alum</a>, 43, since January after spending the holidays together.</p><p class=p1>“Chilli has this permanent smile on her face, she’s so happy and telling everyone she really likes Matthew,”&nbsp;<a href=#>a source exclusively told<i>&nbsp;Us Weekly</i>&nbsp;at the time</a>, revealing Lawrence is equally smitten. “They didn’t intend for things to move as quickly, it was a go-with-the-flow situation but right away, they just clicked and wanted to be together as often as possible. They’re both very optimistic and excited though, it’s an incredibly happy time for them right now.”</p><p class=p1>Amid <a href=#>the pair’s budding romance</a>, the&nbsp;<i>Mrs. Doubtfire&nbsp;</i>actor — who was previously married to&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>&nbsp;</i>alum <a href=#><strong>Cheryl Burke</strong></a> before <a href=#>their divorce last year</a> — has been <a href=#>vocal about having kids</a> with Chilli.</p><p class=p1>“That’s the game plan. That’s what we’re trying to do,” Lawrence <a href=#>confessed to&nbsp;<i>Entertainment Tonight&nbsp;</i>earlier this month</a>. “My life is in complete bloom right now. I get to spend time with an amazing woman like Chilli. I’ve never gotten to be able to experience that kind of relationship before. She’s really, really special.”</p><p class=p1>Nearly two weeks later, the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Brotherly Love</a>&nbsp;</i>alum clarified his comments as he noted that he did not intend to “put any pressure” on his girlfriend.</p><p class=p1>“[My brother]<a href=#> <strong>Joe [Lawrence]</strong> </a>and I were commiserating about this plan that we had to have children together when we were growing up,” Matthew <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>E! News&nbsp;</i>on Wednesday, March 15</a>,&nbsp;referring to his eldest sibling, 46, <a href=#>who is a father of three</a>. “And I missed the first go around and now he’s starting a new family and I was thinking, ‘Man, it’d be great if we could do it again, when I didn’t have the chance to raise a family together.’ So that’s what I meant by that.”</p><p class=p1>Joey, for his part, shares <a href=#>eldest daughters Charleston, 16, and Liberty, 12,</a> with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Chandie Yawn-Nelson</strong></a>. The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Blossom</a>&nbsp;</i>alum and wife <a href=#><strong>Samantha Cope</strong></a> — who tied the knot in 2022 — <a href=#>welcomed their first child together</a>, daughter Dylan, <a href=#>in January</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>While <a href=#>becoming an uncle for the third time</a> has inspired Matthew’s family planning ideas, he has also enjoyed seeing Chilli’s “incredible” bond with her son.</p><p class=p1>“She’s an amazing person,” the<a href=#>&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Girl Meets World</a>&nbsp;</i>alum gushed to&nbsp;<i>E!
