TMZ claims that Madonna’s family, including her sister, Paula, and his father, attempted many times to intervene.</p><p>Madonna has seldom comment on her relationship with her brother, but Anthony had historically criticized the singer in various interviews over the years. He <a href=#>accused her of “turning her back on him”</a> when he was going through a “hard time.” Additionally, he said she “never loved him.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a 2011 interview with Daily Mail, Anthony reveled that sibling rivalry made his relationship with Madonna complicated from childhood.</p><p>“<a href=#>We hated each other - sibling rivalry,</a> I imagine,' he said. 'She was a b***h, just like she is now,’” he said at the time. “She remains true to form. You have to give her credit for consistency.”</p><p>He also accused her of making things difficult for their family. “She’d sneak guys into the house when my father wasn't around and I was supposed to be responsible for us all,” Anthony continued.</p><p>“I’d have to bust the door open and kick the guy out. She didn’t forgive me for that. To me, she was just an annoying sister,” he added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Madonna is worth approximately $850 million, and the musician has received criticism for seemingly not supporting her brother, especially in light of his past comments.</p><p>It’s unclear how much the pop star was paying for his rehab stay or how long she was financially supporting him prior to his death. But it was likely in the tens of thousands. Estimates suggest that the average month stay at a luxury rehab facility <a href=#>costs between $30,000 to $100,000</a>. Standard facilities cost less, usually between $5,000 to $20,000.</p><p>Madonna addressed her brother’s passing in a post to Instagram, writing, “<a href=#>Thank you for blowing my mind as a young girl</a> and introducing me to [jazz musicians] Charlie Parker [and] Miles Davis.” She added, “You planted many important seeds.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Britney Spears Loses Millions Selling Mansion 9 Months After Buying</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6orDOp6WaZaCWtqV5xaipZp2jqb%2Biusaem2aaoqTBqbHRrGSmnZSesKK4jJyYq51dl7Knu9GeZKGho2Kxpq3ToWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
