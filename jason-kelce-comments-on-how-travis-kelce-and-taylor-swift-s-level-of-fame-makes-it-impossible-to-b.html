However, Jason Kelce didn't realize just how challenging the level of fame his brother Travis Kelce is now experiencing could be. <strong>Travis and Taylor Swift have made multiple headlines since they started dating</strong>, something which Jason acknowledged in a new interview with Andrew Santino’s Whiskey Ginger podcast.</p><p>"It's been crazy [and] then <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Travis and Taylor have taken it to another level</a>, and that's a whole other side of it," Jason said in the interview.

"She should be [more famous than me] no doubt," Jason said of his wife. "So, we did the [Kelce] documentary a few years ago and … I think she's a little bit uncomfortable with how much it's become and our family's out there, like, people know what our kids look like."</p><p>He continued, "We've tried to retract from that a little but, I think she enjoys the fact that she gets to go and do charitable outings [and] she gets to give back to the community [and] do clinics with little girls [for] field hockey and all these other things."</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-fans-have-helped-jason-and-travis-kelce>Taylor Swift's Fans Have Helped Jason And Travis Kelce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Jason and Travis Kelce have previously acknowledged how Taylor Swift's fans have helped them, and they gave a shoutout to them after winning an award earlier this year</strong>.
