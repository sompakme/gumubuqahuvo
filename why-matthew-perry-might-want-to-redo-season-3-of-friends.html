While fans knew he suffered during the earlier seasons, Perry actually thought <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was going to die while filming</a>.</p><p>It is no secret that Perry struggled with substance abuse issues during the show, however, it appears as if things were far worse than he led on, especially when it came to season 3, leading the actor to wish he could re-do it. So, what really went down? Let's find out!</p><p><strong>Updated on June 29th, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong> Following his jet ski accident back in 1997, Matthew Perry developed a dependency on pain killers, which ultimately sent him on a downward spiral, so much that he wishes he could re-do season 3 of Friends.&nbsp;During the reunion special last month, Perry admitted that he suffered from immense anxiety when it came to him landing his jokes. If the studio audience didn't laugh, Matthew Perry would "freak out", a detail his own co-stars didn't even know about. Luckily for Perry, he is doing stellar today and even has his own line of Friends merch for sale, all of which are some of Chandler Bing's most iconic quotes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-perry-got-into-a-jet-ski-accident><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Matthew Perry Got Into A Jet Ski Accident</span></h2><p>Matthew Perry got into a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">jet skiing accident</a> and it led him&nbsp;to become dependent on painkillers.

He was almost unrecognizable because of how skinny he was! His clothing hung off of his body super loose and he wasn't filling out his shirts or pants in the best possible ways.</p><p class=p1>His weight loss was very noticeable to fans of Friends who were able to compare his season 3 look to his look from seasons 1 and 2.
