Both of these businesses launched prior to the show being aired and due to them being in their early years at this stage, the Kardashians decided to make the most of the TV show and turned it into a business opportunity.</p><p>Kris revealed on Beyond Candid With Giuliana that the reason why they decided to do the show was that they realized that they would be able to attract more customers to their stores by getting a TV show involved. Whether they realized quite how successful the show would be is unknown, but it at least got them some success.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>After Her Latest Move, Is Kim Kardashian Just Manufacturing Fame?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Smooch was first shut down in 2009 and even though they managed to open a few more DASH stores over the years, that company also got shut down a few years later in 2018.</p><p>While their tactic may not have completely worked for these businesses, the show has given them a much bigger platform and more success than they would have gotten without it.</p><h2 id=the-kardashians-expanded-kuwtk-into-more-business-opportunities>The Kardashians Expanded KUWTK Into More Business Opportunities</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kim-kardashian-on-kuwtk.jpg><p>Since the days of DASH and Smooch, the Kardashians have long moved on and now all individually own some very successful businesses and their momager, Kris, gets to take home an impressive <a href=#>10% of all of their business ventures</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>'s lifestyle brand Pooch, <a href=#><strong>Khlo√© Kardashian</strong></a>'s Good American clothing brand, <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>'s SKIMS shapewear brand, and Kylie's makeup brand Kylie Cosmetics, just to name a few. There was even a recent documentary about how the family has been able to make its money over the years by building up their businesses.</p><p>Given that they own numerous successful businesses, it could easily be mistaken that the Kardashians would have some useful business advice to give to those who want to start their own business. But it turns out that the advice wasn't as well received as they may have hoped.</p><p><a href=#>Kim saw her best business 'advice'</a> as being to tell people to essentially get up and work. Many felt this was the wrong advice to give because it was ignoring that success, particularly in business, isn't always just down to hard work and can also be down to factors such as one's upbringing and being in the right place at the right time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of the Kardashians' success, that little bit of luck might be what tipped the scales.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSiv4ytn55loKS2r8CMqJ1mo5Wavaq6xmasqWWnnsGpedOhnGajkaexor%2FHopinq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
