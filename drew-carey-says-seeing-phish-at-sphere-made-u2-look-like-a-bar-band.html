Might as well.’ I went [and] it blew my mind how great it was and I told all my friends and I talked to the <i>Price Is Right</i> audience how great it was.”</p><p>After going to see Phish, however, Carey said he “honestly was kind of mad … I wanted to call U2 and get my money back.”</p><p>The <i>Price is Right</i> host said that Phish “made [U2] look like a bar band,” adding, “Nothing against U2, it was a great show. I think Phish took full advantage of the audio and the video in that place and what could possibly be done.”</p><p>Carey has been raving about Phish for some time now. Last month, he said he <a href=#>would do anything</a> to see the Vermont band again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Drew-Carey-Says-He-Wanted-My-Money-Back-After-Seeing-U2-Las-Vegas-02.jpg><p>“I swear, I just talked to God,” Carey wrote on X in April. “I would give you all my money, stick my d–k in a blender and swear off p—y for the rest of my life in exchange for this. Bro, I met God tonight for real. I feel like I just got saved by Jesus no lie.”</p><p>X users responded to Carey’s tweets with enthusiasm — and humor.</p><p>‘“I sat behind @DrewFromTV and can attest to what he said! I had no idea it was his first show, but man was he into it! Was so cool seeing a new fan in real time,” one user wrote. The unreal venue helps. You are the man and glad you had fun. Pumped to see you on tour.”</p><p>“Congrats, Drew, on your transcendent weekend,” another wrote. “I truly hope your hotel suite didn’t have a blender in it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Drew-Carey-Says-He-Wanted-My-Money-Back-After-Seeing-U2-Las-Vegas-03.jpg><p>Following their residency announcement in 2023, Phish conveyed their enthusiasm for performing at one of Las Vegas’ most recent venues, which came with a price tag exceeding $2 billion.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“From the moment we first heard about Sphere and its potential, we’ve been dreaming up ways to bring our show to this breathtaking canvas,” lead vocalist and guitarist <b>Trey Anastasio</b> said at the time. “We’re thrilled to present this completely unique experience to Phish fans.”</p><p>Phish performed four dates from April 18 to April 21 2024. U2 performed a total of 40 shows titled “U2: UV Achtung Baby Live at Sphere” from September 2023 to March 2024. The residency marked the debut of the venue with shows centered around the band’s 1991 album <i>Achtung Baby</i>.</p><p>In October 2023, U2 announced an additional 11 dates for the show “due to unprecedented demand,” according to a post on the band’s official Instagram account.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJurnadisKK%2BxLJkrJmpqHq0scSipaBloJ22tLSMmqtmq6CdsrOxjKaYnZ1dqn9uuM6oomakmaCybq2Mm5irZZKWu6V7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
