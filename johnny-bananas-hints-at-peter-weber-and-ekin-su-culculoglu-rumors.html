I’m in the front seat and we’re passing another car [going] in the opposite direction. From the distance, I see there’s a girl in the front right seat of the other one and I see her and my heart kind of stops. I thought it was Kelley and I was 100 percent convinced … but it was Ekin-Su, who looks very similar. From a distance, I was like, ‘Oh, my God.’”</p><p class=p1>Peter previously appeared on <strong>Hannah Brown</strong>’s season 15 of <i>The Bachelorette</i>. He was named the next season’s <i>The Bachelor </i>in 2020 and eventually got engaged to <strong>Hannah Ann Sluss</strong>.

After Peter and Madison’s connection fizzled out within two days, he dated contestant Kelley, 32, again. Peter and Kelley were together on and off for three years until May 2023 <a href=#>when they split for good</a>.
