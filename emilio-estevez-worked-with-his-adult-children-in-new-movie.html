“My son doubles me, and he’s also the stunt coordinator on the film, so there’s a scene in the film where my character gets pummeled, and of course, I’m no dummy, I let him take that hit!” the actor, 56, told Us of his son, Taylor, at the Public New York City premiere on Monday, April 1."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She’s a percussionist, so she came in to lay down some tracks on the film. All of the heavy percussion in the film, that’s my daughter.”</p><p>When it came to working with them, Estevez told Us, “We have a great relationship. My kids are older … so I treat them like colleagues and friends as opposed to children.”</p><p>The Screen Actors Guild Award nominee and his ex-girlfriend, <strong>Carey Salley</strong>, welcomed Taylor, 34, and Paloma, 33, in 1984 and 1986, respectively, before splitting.</p><p>Following their breakup, the St. Elmo’s Fire star was briefly engaged to <a href=#><strong>Demi Moore</strong></a> in 1986, then married <a href=#><strong>Paula Abdul</strong></a> in 1992. They divorced two years later. He became engaged to <strong>Sonja Magdevski</strong> in 2006.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Public, which also stars <a href=#><strong>Alec Baldwin</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jena Malone</strong></a>,<a href=#><strong> Christian Slater</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Gabrielle Union</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Taylor Schilling</strong></a>, will hit theaters on Friday, April 5.</p><p>With reporting by Nicki Gostin</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaepZmhtrB5xKyrnq6Vr3q4u9GknJ1lp57BqXnHoqpmmZSqubV5wqGgpZyimrtutc1mpZ6vXaK8t7XEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
