With just over 40 days until he's set to move away to California to attend Caltech, Sheldon accepts that it's time to say goodbye to some of his favorite things about Medford, Texas.</p><p>Sheldon's goodbyes start off smoothly, until he realizes, with George Cooper's new job offer, he's going to have to say goodbye to his home for good when they sell the house. Young Sheldon season 7, episode 12 is big on family bonding "while they're all still together." And though the direct words are meant to speak to Sheldon's move, it actually foreshadows the last minute of the episode that ultimately tears the Coopers apart and<strong> forces Sheldon to say an even bigger goodbye than losing his childhood room.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this article, we take a look at how saying goodbye to his childhood affects Sheldon in Young Sheldon season 7, episode 12, and how Sheldon's first friend, Tam, plays into it all.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/george-cooper-s-unavoidable-death-becomes-even-more-tragic-after-young-sheldon-season-7-episode-12-promo-clip.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>George Cooper's Unavoidable Death Becomes Even More Tragic After Young Sheldon Season 7, Episode 12 Clip</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Young Sheldon fans know George Cooper's death is coming, but they never expected this to happen first.</span><h2 id=sheldon-39-s-entire-life-is-shaken-up-in-episode-12-of-young-sheldon-season-7>Sheldon's Entire Life Is Shaken Up In Episode 12 Of Young Sheldon Season 7</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/iain-armitage-as-sheldon-cooper-in-young-sheldon-season-7-episode-12iain-armitage-as-sheldon-cooper-in-young-sheldon-season-7-episode-12.jpg><p><a href=#>Sheldon made the decision to attend Caltech</a> in Young Sheldon season 7, episode 9, but as the countdown leading to Sheldon's big move to California closes in, <strong>he prepares to say goodbye to Medford.</strong></p><p>Sheldon is excited for his move to California, until he learns that his father was offered a job coaching college football in Houston, meaning the family would sell the house and move away.

It is revealed in that Big Bang Theory episode that<strong> Sheldon was fearful of moving to California alone and asked Tam to go with him.</strong></p><p>"When I got accepted to grad school at Caltech, I was afraid to move so far away from home, so Tam said he’d move out here with me and be my roommate. Anyway, Tam stayed with her in Texas and I had to move out here all by myself... It was [scary]. I was lonely. And I thought I’d never make a friend again — and for a long time, I didn’t.”</p><p>While Young Sheldon season 7, episode 12 shows Sheldon having "one last lunch" with Tam, and Tam tries to share the news of his serious girlfriend to an uninterested Sheldon, Sheldon didn't explicitly ask Tam to go with him to California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It can be assumed though, that after George Cooper's death, Sheldon could become even more fearful of moving far away from home and reaches out to Tam, the only person he feels comfortable with, to come with him. And feeling sorry for Sheldon's great loss, Tam may have actually agreed to go with Sheldon, even though we know he didn't actually make the move with him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiwqK2enHq0tMSlm6imXaiyor%2FOp2RwZZWltrS7w55kampdqLWmuMOopWafn6Sxo8XEZp6ep6Kcsm6wxJqroWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
