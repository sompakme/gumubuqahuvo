Already, we can see how their careers are headed in different directions. Here's what experts have said about Depp's and Heard's future in Hollywood.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Elon Musk And Amber Heard Really Freeze Embryos Together?

"I think her career is permanently damaged," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McCormick told NY Daily News</a>. Beverly Hills entertainment attorney Mitra Ahouraian also brought up the actress' "unconvincing" act on the stand. "Heard, on the other hand, came off as unconvincing, and her credibility was challenged on multiple occasions. Simply put, the jury did not believe her," she said, adding that the "toxic" online backlash against her would make it tough for her to land roles from now on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from that, Heard won't be able to pay the $10.35 million settlement the court rewarded Depp. "Oh, no, absolutely not," her lawyer Elaine Bredehof told the Today show when asked if her client can afford the settlement. The judge initially ordered her to pay $15 million but later reduced it. <a href=#>The mother-of-one is only worth $8 million</a> as well. <a href=#>A GoFundMe page was even set up to raise $1 million for her</a>. "It's hard to imagine how Amber Heard, considering the millions of dollars in legal fees she has already paid out, will be able to pay Depp the damages imposed by the jury," Ahouraian said of the ordeal. "She made $1 million from the first Aquaman movie, and that was her biggest role to date."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Howard Stern Thinks The Johnny Depp Trial Revealed Everything Wrong With Society</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=johnny-depp-might-still-be-bankable-after-amber-heard-trial>Johnny Depp Might Still Be 'Bankable' After Amber Heard Trial</h2><p>"Not to say that Johnny Depp will get to the place he used to be, but he has a chance at least," McCormick said of the actor's career. He added that <a href=#>The Lone Ranger star</a> "needed to do this" to clean his name. "Johnny Depp needed to do this. Getting some thread of credibility back was very substantial to him," the consultant continued. "If Hollywood thinks he's still bankable, they'll put him in movies." Ahouraian also thinks that the actor did well during the trial. "Depp, on the witness stand, came off as likable, endearing and authentic," she raved. "He owned up to his flaws and held himself fully accountable, but refused to be accused of something he maintained he did not do, and that won him points, both with the public and with the jury."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added that it would be a good PR move for Depp to reject Heard's settlement or donate it to charity. "What would be an interesting plot twist is if he rejected the money, or accepted it and actually donated it to charity," she suggested. Legal analyst Emily D. Baker told People the same thing. "It will be up to the parties, but once the judgment is entered on June 24, I wonder if the attorneys will start negotiating that judgment payment," she said. "Ben Chew said in his closing argument that Johnny Depp wasn't seeking to punish Amber Heard with money [Chew said on Friday to the jury: The case 'has never been about money' or about 'punishing' Heard.] I imagine that they will try to settle it and you'll see a PR statement that they are not seeking to enforce the judgment."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Zendaya's Fans Are Absolutely Furious With Amber Heard</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-amber-heard-and-johnny-depp-have-said-about-the-verdict>What Amber Heard And Johnny Depp Have Said About The Verdict</h2><p>Just minutes after the verdict, Heard posted a statement on social media, calling the judgment a "setback" for women. "The disappointment I feel today is beyond words," she wrote. "I'm heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence and sway of my ex husband. I'm even more disappointed what this verdict means for women. It is a setback. It sets back the clock to a time when a woman who spoke up and spoke up could be publicly shamed and humiliated. It sets back the idea that violence against women should be taken seriously."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depp mostly expressed gratitude in his statement. "Six years ago, my life, the life of my children, the lives of those closest to me, and also, the lives of the people who for many, many years have supported and believed in me were forever changed," he wrote. "All in the blink of an eye. False, very serious and criminal allegations were levied at me via the media, which triggered an endless barrage of hateful content, although no charges were ever brought against me. It had already traveled around the world twice within a nanosecond and it had a seismic impact on my life and my career. And six years later, the jury gave me my life back. I am truly humbled."</p><p>He also thanked "the Judge, the jurors, the court staff and the Sheriffs who have sacrificed their own time to get to this point, and to my <a href=#>diligent and unwavering legal team</a> who did an extraordinary job in helping me to share the truth."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Johnny Depp Turned Down A Film Because Of Brad Pitt, Here's What Happened</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYra0edahmK1lla29pr7TrGSpqpWZtqTAjJqZqK2kYrewtM2nsGaclaW9bq3Mm5yrZZiarrOw0madrqylp7Jutc1mn6iknK7EsLvDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
