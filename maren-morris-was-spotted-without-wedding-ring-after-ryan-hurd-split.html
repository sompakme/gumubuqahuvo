You screamed and cried with me on the deep cuts and even got me back on stage for a few more I hadn’t planned to play. I couldn’t leave you. Thank you for always reminding me why I do this,” she wrote via Instagram on October 5. “It’ll be hard to top, but I knew we had good, historical reason for kicking this shit off in Chicago. 💕🌳🔥.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Maren-Morris-Ditched-Her-Wedding-Ring-Days-After-Filing-for-Divorce-From-Ryan-Hurd-422.jpg><p>Photos from the event showed Morris posing without her ring. She made another public appearance on Wednesday, October 11, for the premiere of <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>‘s concert movie <a href=#>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour at The Grove in Los Angeles.</a> The country singer looked glamorous in a shiny leather mini dress but was once again missing her ring.</p><p>Before their split, Morris and Hurd, 36, <a href=#>weren’t afraid to put their love on display</a>. The pair met during a writing session in 2013 but it took two years for them to start dating. They got engaged in 2017 and Us broke the news about their nuptials one year later.</p><p>Morris later reflected on <a href=#>how going on tour in 2018 affected their marriage.</a></p><p>“It was probably the hardest part of our relationship. We went on our honeymoon, and then I immediately went on this gigantic tour opening for <a href=#><strong>Niall Horan</strong></a>,” she told Esquire in 2019. “It was more international touring than I had ever done. And I was gone more than I had ever been on any other tour.”</p><p>Morris referred to that period of time as a “tough summer,” <a href=#>which led the couple to attend therapy together.</a></p><p>“We have grown so much closer because we had to make some hard decisions and have some tough talks about what this future looks like and how we can make this better,” she added at the time. “I have always loved him, but I feel like I like him in ways I never knew I could before.”</p><p>Morris and Hurd <a href=#>expanded their family with son Hayes</a>, who they welcomed in 2020. Hurd has since praised Morris for her dedication to their child.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Happy Mother’s Day to Hayes’ beautiful Mama. We are the luckiest to be yours,” he wrote via Instagram in May 2022. “He has the wildest life and I wouldn’t change a thing. We love you!”</p><p>Morris, meanwhile, <a href=#>took to social media to gush</a> over their personal and professional accomplishments.</p><p>“I can’t imagine doing last night’s show without you,” she captioned an Instagram Story in 2022 alongside footage from their surprise duet during her headlining show at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Bowl. “‘I can’t love you any more than I do now’ just isn’t true because I know tomorrow I’ll love you even more.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKau265zqupoqtdrK60edKppq2slZl6uLXToaaurF2ssqWwyKeeZqqZo7RurcWtnKtloq6ur3nHrqmdZaOluarAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
