The club’s chief later described the complaint by Maribor regarding Bocanegra’s eligibility as ‘pathetic mischief-making’.</p><p>He scored his first goal for Rangers in the second leg of the Maribor tie as Rangers crashed out 3–2 on aggregate. Bocanegra scored his first league goal for the club on the 24th of September against&nbsp;Dunfermline Athletic&nbsp;in a 4–0 win.</p><p>His second goal came three months later, on December 17, 2011, during a 2-1 win over&nbsp;Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

Although many players departed because of this, Bocanegra’s future was uncertain after not attending training,&nbsp;as he wanted to leave in order to play at a higher level.</p><p>A few weeks later, on July 29, 2012, McCoist appointed Bocanegra captain for the first round of the Challenge Cup- a 2-1 win over&nbsp;Brechin City. After the game Bocanegra announced his intention to stay, vowing not to walk away from the club.</p><p>He then made six appearances at the start of the season.

Bocanegra expressed a desire to return to Rangers once his loan deal has expired.&nbsp;He made his debut for the club, on September 22, 2012, in a 1-0 win over&nbsp;CD Mirandés.</p><p>However, his time at Santander was considered “disastrous”,&nbsp;as he failed to start the remainder of the matches, though still played regularly, coming on as a substitute. The club was relegated to next division.</p><p>On April 9, 2013, Carlos announced on his&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;page that he would return to&nbsp;Rangers&nbsp;for the&nbsp;2013–14&nbsp;season.&nbsp;Though announcing his return, U.S. National Team Manager&nbsp;Jürgen Klinsmann&nbsp;warned Carlos not to play for Rangers next season.</p><h4>Chivas USA</h4><p>In the summer of 2013, Bocanegra left Rangers&nbsp;and signed with&nbsp;Chivas USA. Chivas USA traded up the allocation order with&nbsp;Toronto FC&nbsp;to land his signature, sending a first-round&nbsp;2015 MLS SuperDraft pick and an international slot to the Canadian club.</p><p>Bocanegra retired at the end of the 2014 MLS season. In 2010, Carlos was purchased by Ligue 1 club Saint-Étienne, reportedly for a fee of £400,000. He later played for Scottish Premier League side Rangers and Racing Santander.

He started two of three games at left-back during the 2006 World Cup.

Bocanegra was subsequently not a part of the team at the 2013 Gold Cup or the 2014 World Cup.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carlos-bocanegra-after-football></span><span>Carlos Bocanegra After football</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carlos Bocanegra was appointed the technical director of Atlanta United in March 2015.
