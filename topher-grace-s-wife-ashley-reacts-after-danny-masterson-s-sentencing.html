In May, he was found guilty on two counts of rape. (He first stood trial in November 2022, which <a href=#>ended in a mistrial after the jury was deadlocked</a> on a unanimous decision.)</p><p class=p1>Masterson was&nbsp;<a href=#>arrested and charged in 2020&nbsp;</a>with three counts of rape after multiple women <a href=#>accused him of assault</a> back in the early 2000s. He vehemently denied the accusations at the time.</p><p class=p1>“From day one, I have denied the outrageous allegations against me. Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit,”&nbsp;Masterson <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in a December 2017 statement</a>. “I have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one. In this country, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. However, in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Topher-Graces-Wife-Ashley-Supports-Assault-Victims-After-Danny-Mastersons-Sentencing-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>Following Masterson’s scandal, he was <a href=#>written off&nbsp;<i>The Ranch</i></a>. He starred on the Netflix show with fellow&nbsp;<i>That 70’s Show&nbsp;</i>alum <a href=#><strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong></a>. Despite the on-camera departure, Masterson still remained close with Kutcher, 45, and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Mila Kunis</strong></a>. Kutcher and the 40-year-old actress, who<a href=#> met on the set of&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>That 70’s Show</a>,&nbsp;</i>even <a href=#>wrote letters of support on Masterson’s behalf</a> before the sentencing. In their notes, Kutcher and Kunis pleaded with the judge for a lenient sentence so that Masterson <a href=#>could be a “present father”</a> to his daughter, Fianna. (Masterson shares the 9-year-old with wife <a href=#><strong>Bijou Phillips</strong></a>.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Fellow&nbsp;<i>That 70’s Show&nbsp;</i>stars <a href=#><strong>Debra Jo Rupp</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kurtwood Smith</strong></a>, who p<a href=#>layed Grace’s onscreen parents</a>, also penned notes advocating on Masterson’s behalf. Grace, 45, has not publicly addressed Masterson’s sentencing.</p><p class=p1>Grace, who married Hinshaw in 2016, previously confessed that he “never saw any of that behavior” during his time on&nbsp;<i>70’s Show. “</i>I feel like it sounds like I’m defending him, but the truth is I never saw any of that stuff,” he <a href=#>previously told&nbsp;<i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>&nbsp;in 2018. “I was, of that cast, the most boring.
