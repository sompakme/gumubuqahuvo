As a result of Love's lack of major acting experience, casting her in that movie was a big risk at the time.</p><p>Fortunately, Love earned rave reviews for her acting in the project, and she reportedly went on to get cast in a classic movie. However, Love says that <a href=#>Brad Pitt torpedoed her acting career</a> at that time.</p><p>Since Love didn't get along with Pitt and <a href=#>co-stars like Ashley Benson and Lucy Hale feud</a> all the time, that begs an obvious question. How did Love and her The People vs Larry Flynt co-star Woody Harrelson get along during the making of the movie?</p><h2 id=did-courtney-physically-attack-woody-harrelson>Did Courtney Physically Attack Woody Harrelson?</h2><p>When most people think of Woody Harrelson, they envision the lovable guy he almost always seems to be. Harrelson's bond with Matthew McConaughey and moments like when he realized Liam and Chris Hemsworth are brothers make him seem like someone fans would love to be friends with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woody-harrelson-and-matthew-mcconaughey-s-friendship.jpg><p>Considering how chill Harrelson appears to be, it seems hard to believe that he would fight anyone. However, since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harrelson once got in trouble for a physical altercation</a>, it seems pretty clear that just like everyone else, he is capable of getting wrapped up in violent situations.</p><p>With that in mind, it is interesting to know that according to a report, Harrelson once got attacked by one of his co-stars. It is all the more remarkable that the co-star Harrelson allegedly once got attacked by was Courtney Love.</p><p>According to a 2013 Purple Revolver article, Harrelson and Love butted heads early on in the process of making The People vs Larry Flynt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Courtney Love Made Major Changes To Her $27,000 Per Month New York Apartment And Got Kicked Out Because of It</a></span></p><p>When people think about how rock stars act, showing up to appointments on time is the furthest thing from what comes to mind. When Courtney Love began working on The People vs. Larry Flynt, she seemingly believed that showing up late was an acceptable thing to do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woody-harrelson-and-courtney-love-s-relationship-while-making-the-people-vs-larry-flynt-was-deeply-complicated-for-this-reason-1.jpg><p>When there was supposed to be a script reading, Love left Harrelson and other people involved in The People vs Larry Flynt waiting. When Harrelson confronted her about being unprofessional, things blew up according to a Purple Revolver report that seemingly quoted Harrelson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She walks in and she’s mumbling some stupid excuse about this and that. I told her, ‘well, I had this and that to do but I was still here on time.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/courtney-love-looking-annoyed.jpg><p>Purple Revolver's report claims that Love didn't respond to Harrelson calling her out for being late by apologizing. Instead, that publication claims that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Love responded by attacking Harrelson</a>.</p><p>"After a physical confrontation in which Love lunged at Harrelson, The Hunger Games actor remembers pinning the singer down, demanding an apology. Woody added in a heartfelt admission that he sometimes wishes he was like his on screen persona Woody Boyd. He added: 'It would of been great if I’d been as easy-going as Woody in Cheers.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Purple Revolver isn't a reputable source, it makes sense not to take the publication's reporting at face value. Furthermore, Purple Revolver's article doesn't cite any sources for their report about the alleged incident. However, there is a reason to think that is at least some validity to Purple Revolver's report.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Courtney Love Once Turned Down Advances From Russell Brand Because Of The Way He Smelled</a></span></p><p>In 1997, MTV News spoke to Harrelson, Love, and their co-star Edward Norton. During that interview, MTV's interviewer John Norris brought up reports that Harrelson and Love didn't get along at first because she didn't show up on time.</p><p>"Despite a well-publicized tiff over Ms. Love's tardiness upon their first meeting . . ." In response to Norris' comment, Harrelson confirmed that at the very least he was annoyed by Love's initially unprofessional behavior. "I was like 'this rock and roll thing about showing up when you want is not gonna happen.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the day, Purple Revolver's reporting about Love lunging at Harrelson could be false or exaggerated. Whether the two actors had a violent altercation or not, the fact remains that their relationship got off on a bad foot.</p><h2 id=did-courtney-love-and-woody-harrelson-become-friends>Did Courtney Love And Woody Harrelson Become Friends?</h2><p>In life, first impressions can be everything at times. The fact that Courtney Love angered Woody Harrelson when they first started working together could have been a harbinger of things to come. Fortunately for Harrelson and Love, however, they actually grew to have a lot of love and appreciation for each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woody-harrelson-and-courtney-love-the-people-vs-larry-flynt.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2012, Esquire published an article about Harrelson. In that piece, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harrelson was quoted saying something extremely complimentary of Love</a>. "She was amazing. As an actor, she probably taught me more than almost anybody."</p><p>In 1996, US Weekly published an article looking at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harrelson and Love's unique working relationship</a>. At one point in the piece, it describes how the two actors felt no chemistry while working together and tried to find it by becoming inebriated but still felt no attraction to each other.</p><p>While that anecdote is strange, US Weekly's piece also revealed how Harrelson and Love had fun together on set. In between takes, Harrelson started messing around to entertain the extras and Love joined in on the fun without missing a beat.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Frances Bean Cobain Resented Courtney Love After She Lost Custody, Here's The Truth About Their Relationship Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There was the time when they were shooting on a stage before a large crowd of Memphis extras. During a break, he jumped up to the microphone and pretended to be an evangelical preacher. Love suddenly staggered onstage wearing sunglasses and holding her hands out, pretending to be blind."</p><p>Us Weekly's article continued, "I said, 'Be healed!' " recalls Harrelson, pantomiming how he pushed Love away with the palm of his hand. 'And she pretended she could see, and everyone was cheering. And then,' he adds, "we sang 'Amazing Grace.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woody-harrelson-smiling.jpg><p>In 1996, Harrelson also revealed to US Weekly that he and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Love became friendly enough that he took her to a play</a>. Unfortunately for Harrelson, however, he took Love to see a live performance of "Death of a Salesman" and she left him embarrassed</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Head back, mouth open, loud snoring - and her legs! At the beginning of the second act, her legs would just suddenly go over the seat in front of her and there’d be a big bustle of her (waking up), and then she’d fall back to sleep and they’d go back up. And the snoring was loud. She has a very unique decibel level. I was so anxiety ridden.”</p><p>Between arguments early on and a lack of chemistry in real life, Harrelson and Love's working relationship was complicated. However, all's well that ends well and Harrelson and Love clearly grew to have a lot of affection for each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuqKeUrnqprdGrnKWrn6N6pLvUq6unnaliubDCxKxkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXay1qrjEZqSao5mjtG68xKinpZ1dq8BuuMCrqbJllqHGr8CMm5yhoZ6ZerW0xGaqnJ2emsBussSum2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
