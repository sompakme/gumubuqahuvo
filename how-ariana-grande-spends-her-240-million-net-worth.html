The star first came to prominence on Broadway before landing her role as Cat Valentine on Victorious.</p><p>Following her days on Nickelodeon, <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a> went on to become one of the biggest pop stars in the world. With her debut album, Yours Truly released in 2013 cementing the star as one worth watching, her other albums have only amassed millions more!</p><p>In addition to her singing, Grande was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">paid $8 million for her performance at Coachella</a> in 2019, which is quite a pretty paycheck. That year alone, the star reportedly collected $50 million in total, earning herself $1 million for every show of her Sweetener tour.</p><p>So, with all these riches, what does Grande spend her millions on? Diamonds and lashes, of course!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ariana-grande-dated-multiple-men-fresh-out-of-long-term-relationships-here-s-why-according-to-experts-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Ariana Grande Dated Multiple Men Fresh Out Of Long Term Relationships, Here's Why</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Ariana Grande is notorious for easily falling in and out of love with men who have just gone through breakups.</span><p><strong>Updated January 2024:</strong> Ariana Grande has diversified her career in the entertainment industry, with endorsements, and real estate ventures. This has allowed Grande to continuously earn $40 to $50 million per year as of late.</p><p>Currently, Grande is working on the film, 'Wicked', playing the character Glenda. She is also releasing new music in January 2024, for the first time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in three years, with the single, 'Yes, And?'</a>. However, Grande also allegedly <a href=#>owes money to her former manager, Scooter Braun</a>, despite firing him.

And when Grande does her own grocery shopping, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opts for a pricey spot like Whole Foods!</a></p><p>Grande only "organic and vegan produce", hence her love for the grocer. In November 2013, the singer tweeted, "I love @wholefoods so much there actually aren't words. Just fruits and veggies and sesame tofu and friendly, peaceful people everywhere."</p><p>Users on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit have even reported running into the musician</a> doing her own grocery shopping and acting comepletely normal.</p><p>Grande is plant-based and made that lifestyle change in 2018. With a diet as clean as hers, it's no surprise that it comes at quite a price! The change in lifestyle comes as a result of Grande claiming to love animals more than people. That, however, hasn't stopped Grande from wearing designer goods, some of which are made out of leather.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ariana-grande-loves-luxury-fashion>Ariana Grande Loves Luxury Fashion</h2><h3 id=ariana-grande-39-s-favorite-designers-are-chanel-and-louis-vuitton>Ariana Grande's favorite designers are Chanel and Louis Vuitton</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar49436499-1.jpg><p>Grande is not one who is a novice when it comes to her luxury fashion. Be it a Fendi puffer jacket that, according to Page Six cost $2,890 or $1,500 Sergio Rossi boots, spending cash on designer labels is all in a day's work for Grande. However, these purchases are just a drop in the bucket compared to what Grande purchases of her favorite designers, Chanel and Louis Vuitton. As such, the collection of fashion that Grande has been able to amass is massive and impressive.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/inside-ariana-grande-s-most-confrontational-interviews-deposite.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Ariana Grande's Most Confrontational Interviews Proves The Singer Isn't Afraid To Clap Back</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Ariana Grande may have a voice of an angel, but she's quick to clap back if she doesn't like what she hears.</span><p>Considering Grande's net worth is so high, she barely makes a dent in her account when she goes on shopping sprees!

This is because over the years she has purchased various California homes to only turn around and sell them a year or so later for a profit of $1 to $3 million.

Grande's obsession with Hepburn started at a young age, hence her 7 Rings's sampling of Breakfast At Tiffany's, which lost <a href=#>Grande money despite it being a successful song</a>.
