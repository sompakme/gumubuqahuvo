Now they’re not. So that’s why I was just, like, I want to get them out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tyler-Hubbard-Wife-Hayley-Reveals-Why-She-Had-Her-Breast-Implants-Removed-02.jpg><p>Hayley, who shares <a href=#>daughter Olivia, 3, and sons Luca, 18 months and Atlas, 5 months</a>, with the <a href=#>Florida Georgia Line singer</a>, 34, said multiple factors played into her choice.</p><p>“I don’t know that I was feeling badly; I’ve been pregnant for three years, so it could’ve been a number of things,” she explained. “But, just the anxiety of having them in my body was not worth it, and I just kind of wanted a more natural look.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Vogue Trip blogger</a> revealed that after her implants were taken out, her doctors performed a fat transfer, taking fat from another part of her body to put into her breasts, for a “more natural” look and a smaller cup size.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tyler-Hubbard-Wife-Hayley-Reveals-Why-She-Had-Her-Breast-Implants-Removed.jpg><p>“I highly recommend it, if it is for you,” she said, admitting, “it did hurt quite a bit, the fat transfer hurt a lot, actually.” Hayley added that the implant removal portion “was not painful” after the first few days, but the fat transfer “was a lot more than I expected.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Nashville resident</a> gave a shout-out to her “incredible” Los Angeles-based surgeon, Dr. Sheila Nazarian, before reminding her fans to speak with a professional if they’re interested in something similar.</p><p>“I’m still learning a lot about breast implant illness,” she concluded. “Again, I did mine because I was just being proactive and wanted to get ahead of it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hayley first spoke out about her breast surgery in <a href=#>a Valentine’s Day Instagram post</a> last month, noting she was recovering on the actual holiday.</p><p>“It may not have looked romantic this year to most. It was messy and not so pretty but, I was right where I needed to be with the person I love most and that’s all that mattered,” she wrote on February 16, alongside a series of photos with Tyler over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGatsZyav2601JuZmqqUqHq4tcWeZKGZqaGyunnRnq2emZyoeri02GaqoZ1dp7Kuu9Wem2aaopqutMCMoqSppJGjwbR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
