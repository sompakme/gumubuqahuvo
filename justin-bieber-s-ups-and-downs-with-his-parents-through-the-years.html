The “Yummy” singer was born in March 1994 in Toronto, Canada, where he was primarily raised by Mallette — then a teen mom who struggled financially.
“As a single mother [I sometimes said], ‘I have no idea how I’m going to feed Justin,’” Mallette told Canadian Christian talk show 100 Huntley Street in 2008."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Mallette even <a href=#>wrote a book</a> about her journey as a single teen mom, called Nowhere But Up: The Story of Justin Bieber’s Mom.</p><p>“I grew up with not a lot of money,” Justin later told <a href=#>The New York Times</a>. “We never owned a house.”</p><h2>2000s</h2><p>As Justin honed his talent for music — as well as a variety of sports — he earned enough money busking on the streets of Stratford, Ontario, to take Mallette, who always supported his interests, to Disney World.</p><p>“Growing up, I actually used to busk on the street. I’d play my guitar, sing, and people would throw money in the case,” Justin told Interview magazine in 2015. ”That was really fun, and I actually got enough money to <a href=#>bring my mom to Florida to go to Disney World</a>, because I always wanted to go but we never had enough money.”</p><p>As Justin began his music career on YouTube as a young teen, Mallette was with him every step of the way — from being discovered by <a href=#><strong>Scooter Braun</strong></a> to touring with him in the early days of his career.</p><h2>2009 to 2018</h2><p>As Justin skyrocketed to fame in 2009 after being discovered on YouTube, his family also grew as well. Jeremy welcomed son Jaxon in November of that year, followed by daughter Jazmyn in 2013. He shares both of his younger children with ex-wife <strong>Erin Wagner</strong>. (After Jeremy married <strong>Chelsey Rebelo</strong> in February 2018, her daughter, Allie, became Justin’s stepsister. The <a href=#>couple later welcomed Justin’s third half-sibling</a>, Bay, in September 2018.)</p><p>Justin has often shared his close bond with his siblings throughout the years, frequently posting sweet photos with them on social media and even taking Jaxon as his date to the Grammys in 2016.</p><h2>2015 to 2016</h2><p>In 2015, Justin he explained to Billboard the reason for his estrangement from Mallette:</p><p>“I was distant because I was ashamed,” he explained. “We spent some time not talking, so it takes time to rebuild that trust. She’s living in Hawaii now, so it’s hard, but getting better. She’s an amazing woman and I love her.”</p><p>In a February 2016 interview with GQ, Justin revealed that he was, at the time, “<a href=#>a lot closer to my dad than I am to my mom</a>.”</p><h2>August 2016</h2><p>After nude photos of Justin leaked online, Jeremy <a href=#>seemingly bragged about his eldest son’s penis size</a>&nbsp;on social media.</p><p>“My boy,” Jeremy wrote via Twitter alongside a cactus emoji. He also shared a photo of Toronto’s famously tall CN tower and tagged Justin in the picture. His social media posts were quickly deleted.</p><h2>2017</h2><p>Justin expressed his gratitude for his dad via <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>“I love continuing to get to know my father. I love working through hard things to get to the good things,” the “Let Me Love You” singer penned at the time. “Relationships are worth fighting for especially with family!! Love you forever and always daddy!”</p><h2>February 2018</h2><p>Justin’s then-girlfriend,<a href=#><strong> Selena Gomez</strong></a>, jetted to Jamaica to <a href=#>celebrate his dad’s wedding</a> to Rebelo.</p><p>“They were having a great time, it was very relaxed,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time. “The guests along with Justin and Selena enjoyed the entire day. They were very sweet, very affectionate.”</p><h2>September 2019</h2><p>After Justin and Gomez split for good in June 2018, the “Love Yourself” singer wasted no time in getting back together with <a href=#><strong>Hailey Bieber</strong></a>, whom he also dated on and off for years. The two tied the knot that September, and later <a href=#>celebrated with a blowout bash in September 2019</a>, which was attended by both Mallette and Jeremy.</p><p>“What a whirlwind. So proud,” Mallette <a href=#>gushed</a> over Justin and Hailey’s marriage via social media. “Happy ever after baby.”</p><h2>June 2023</h2><p>Jeremy came under fire after sharing a series of tweets during <a href=#>Pride Month</a> that many found deeply offensive.</p><p>“Don’t forget to thank a straight person this month for your existence,” he tweeted (and deleted) at the time, alongside a Pride flag.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In response to the backlash, Jeremy apologized in a follow-up tweet.</p><p>“Acknowledging the nuclear family is offensive?” he asked. “My apologies to those offended. Was not my intent. Not that my opinion matters.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajraOptq95waKcm52iqHq2vNJmmKecXZm8uLrSZq6irJhitaq%2FjKmYq52eqcBuwMerpq6fmGLBqbGMspyaqqNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
