The actress was blacklisted from the entertainment industry at the time, leading her to part ways with Virgin Records. She produced one album with Island Records four years later, only to launch her own record label in 2015. She has continued to release her music as an independent artist since her involvement with Rhythm Nation, in partnership with BMG Rights Management.</p><p>The pop culture icon married <strong>James DeBarge</strong> in 1984, but the union was annulled the following year. Janet went on to marry <strong>René Elizondo Jr.</strong> in 1991. They divorced nine years later. The “All for You” singer was involved in a long-term relationship with music exec <a href=#><strong>Jermaine Dupri</strong></a>, but rumors of a split swirled when Dupri was noticeably absent from <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>‘s funeral in July 2009. The “Black Cat” singer moved on with billionaire <strong>Wissam Al Mana</strong>, the duo got married in 2012 and welcomed a son five years later. The twosome announced their separation in 2017.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnmpa7psCMo5ico6Oku3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
