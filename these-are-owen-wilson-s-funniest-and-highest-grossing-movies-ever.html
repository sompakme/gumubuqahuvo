For those who know already, Wilson lent his voice to the computer-animated sports comedy, Cars which was first released in 2006 by <a href=#>Walt Disney Pictures</a>. Among a few of the most highlighted movies of his career, there is Shanghai Knights (2003) where he starred beside Jackie Chan, The Cable Guy, starring opposite Jim Carrey, The Big Bounce (2004) opposite Morgan Freeman and Charlie Sheen, Anaconda (1997) co-starring with Jenifer Lopez, Jon Voight, and Ice Cube, and a ton of other great matchups and classic flicks. At just 53-year old with a net worth of $70 million, Owen Wilson doesn't seem to have plans on mashing the breaks anytime soon. His latest film entitled Marry Me was released in February 2022 and stars <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> and Maluma Bastian. Here are the 10 highest-grossing movies of Owen Wilson's eccentric acting career.</p><h2 id=night-at-the-museum>Night At The Museum</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Having worked in a multitude of projects with fellow comedian, Ben Stiller, it came as no surprise to see Owen Wilson featured in the fantasy comedy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Night At The Museum,</a> released in 2006. The film follows Larry Daley (Ben Stiller), a Brooklyn native whose ex-wife, Erica Daley (Kim Raver), sees his unstable work history as a bad example for their son, Nick (Jake Cherry). Motivated to not have Nick place Erica's new fiance, Don (<a href=#>Paul Rudd</a>) in higher regard than him, he applies for a job as night security at the Museum of Natural History. The veteran guard, Cecil Fredericks (Dick Van Dyke) informs Larry that he, Gus (Mickey Rooney), and Reginald (Bill Cobbs) are retiring and he will be replacing them, due to declining visitors. His first night revealed that the museum's artifacts come to life through the power of the Golden Tablet of Pharoah Akhmenrah, and they include Theodore Roosevelt's statue (Robin Williams), Pharoah Akhmenrah (<a href=#>Rami Malek</a>), Jedidah the cowboy (Owen Wilson), and many others. The statues also turn to dust if they are found outside the museum at sunrise. The intriguing film grossed $579.44 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cars-2>Cars 2</h2><p>Owen Wilson's filmography isn't made up of only one night stands at crashed wedding parties and strange nights at the museum. A large part of his net worth can be attributed to his role in the computer-animated comedy film installment, Cars. Despite the first film series being released in 2006, it was 2011's Cars 2 that saw the most <a href=#>financial success</a>, grossing $560.15 million at the global box office. The film surrounds Lightning McQueen (Owen Wison) who is now a four-time Piston Cup race winner. A British spy car (Finn McMissile) learns that Professor Zundapp (Thomas Kretschmann) is the leader of the lemons. Meanwhile, McQueen plans to enjoy his offseason in Radiator Springs with his pals, Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), Luigi (Tony Shalhoub), Guido, and Fillmore but is challenged by Italian formula race car, Francesco Bernoulli (<a href=#>John Turturro</a>), which he accepts! Other main actors in the movie are Emily Mortimer, Bruce Campbell, and Joe Mantegna. Against a budget of $200 million, the film grossed $560.15 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=armageddon>Armageddon</h2><p>The film adaptation for one of the most likely catastrophic extinction-level events to happen to Earth was released in 1998 under the fitting title, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Armageddon.</a> The <a href=#>science-fiction </a>disaster film highlights the first kamikaze mission NASA sends their astronauts on after realizing that the Earth only has 18 days before a Texas-sized asteroid makes an impact, destroying everything in its wake. NASA executive, Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) plans to recruit the world's best deep core oil driller, Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), to train other astronauts to drill a hole into the asteroid, insert a nuclear bomb that, once detonated, will break the asteroid in two. Harry agrees to help, but on the condition that his oil-digging team comes along, which consists of A.J. Frost (<a href=#>Ben Affleck</a>), Chick Chapel (Will Patton), Rockhound (Steve Buscemi), Oscar Choice (Owen Wilson), Grace Stamper (Liv Tyler), and Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan). The dramatic doomsday film grossed $554.60 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meet-the-fockers>Meet The Fockers</h2><p>A few years after the mayhem of Meet the Parents in 2000, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and his fiance Pam Byrnes (<a href=#>Teri Polo</a>) decide to take their relationship to the next step by introducing each other to their parents in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meet The Fockers. </a>That's when things get interesting.

When he stops by the museum one day, he learns from Dr. McPhee (<a href=#>Ricky Gervais</a>) that the artifacts are being moved to the Smithsonian Institution, only to be replaced with holographic depictions. He spends one more night in the museum with his friends and learns from Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams) that when the artifacts move, they will lose their ability to come alive at night, as the Tablet of Akhenrah will be staying, along with himself, Pharoah Akhmenrah, and the Tyrannosaurus Rex. The following day, the artifacts are moved, and Jedidah (Owen Wilson) informs Larry that Dexter the monkey has talked the Tablet.

But that didn't last much longer once the younger, faster, and more technologically advanced rookie Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer), who McQueen suffers a violent crash from while trying to keep up with him. Accepting that he won't be able to beat Storm with speed, McQueen is assigned to train under Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), but later calls Mater (Larry The Cable Guy) to track down Doc's trainer, Smokey (<a href=#>Chris Cooper)</a>.
