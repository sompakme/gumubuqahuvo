Fans wondered about <a href=#>her exciting Travis Kelce romance</a> before it was confirmed, wanted to know more about <a href=#>her most quotable song lyrics</a>, and are forever curious about her <a href=#>ex-boyfriends who have a lot of money</a>.</p><p>People also spread <strong>rumors that Taylor Swift is feuding with many celebrities</strong>. Of course, most of these stories aren't true, but that doesn't stop people from believing that she doesn't get along with most other stars. One of the most memorable rumors is that Swift and <strong><a href=#>Olivia Munn</a> </strong>don't like each other. In this article, we'll take a look at the stars Swift allegedly fought with, along with the reason why fans thought that this was the case.</p><h2 id=olivia-munn-and-taylor-swift-39-s-awards-show-joke-led-to-feud-rumors><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Olivia Munn And Taylor Swift's Awards Show Joke Led To Feud Rumors</span></h2><h3 id=olivia-munn-stars-in-the-appletv-series-your-friends-and-neighbors>Olivia Munn Stars In The AppleTV+ Series Your Friends And Neighbors</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/everything-we-know-about-olivia-munn-s-net-worth-and-how-she-earned-it-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have been <a href=#>perplexed by Taylor Swift and Olivia Munn's relationship</a> for a while now.<strong> Munn and Swift interacted at the 2013 People's Choice Awards </strong>and Munn acted like she was going to take Swift's award away. Since Kanye West famously interrupted Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Awards, Munn was alluding to that and later said it was meant to be funny.</p><p>People might have expected Swift and Munn to admit to a feud after this awards show moment. However, they never said that they were mad at each other or that they had any problems with their brief interaction. Of course, since people talk about everything that Swift does, it makes sense that people couldn't stop wondering about what really happened at the People's Choice Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Olivia Munn's Best Roles</p></th><th scope=col></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</p></td><td><p>2010-2011</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sloan Sabbith on The Newsroom</p></td><td><p>2012-2014</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Elizabeth Braddock/Psylocke in X-Men: Apocalypse</p></td><td><p>2016</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tracey Hughes in Office Christmas Party</p></td><td><p>2016</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tiffany in Buddy Games</p></td><td><p>2019</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=justin-bieber-and-taylor-swift-allegedly-feuded-over-scooter-braun><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Justin Bieber And Taylor Swift Allegedly Feuded Over Scooter Braun</span></h2><h3 id=scooter-braun-has-been-justin-bieber-39-s-manager-since-bieber-was-13>Scooter Braun Has Been Justin Bieber's Manager Since Bieber Was 13</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/how-much-does-justin-bieber-make-per-concert-after-taxes-and-expenses_-deposit-copy-1.jpg><p><a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> and Taylor Swift may have a lot in common since they both got started in the music industry as young teenagers.

According to Nicki Swift, fans believe that the two singers dislike each other because <strong>Lovato made several negative comments about Swift</strong>. When Swift gave Kesha $250,000 for legal fees during her legal fight against Dr. Luke, Lovato said that other people aren't in the same financial position. Lovato also said:</p><p>“Don't brand yourself a feminist if you don't do the work.”</p><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lovato has many celebrity friends</a> such as Sam Smith and Ariana Grande, according to Pop Sugar, the rumor that she was fighting with Swift continued for a long time.
