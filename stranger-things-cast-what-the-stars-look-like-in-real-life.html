Even though many villains are introduced throughout the years, Vecna <a href=#>quickly becomes the town’s worst nightmare in season 4.</a></p><p>According to <a href=#><strong>Jamie Campbell Bower</strong></a>, bringing the monster to life <a href=#>required him to spend seven and a half hours in makeup.</a> The transformation, however, was just as much about the mental preparation as it was the physical.</p><p>“For Vecna, there’s this deep, deep, deep resentment. It’s his fuel, so I really had to tap into that, and I consider myself not somebody who holds onto resentment. So, digging that up from within me was quite a lot,” the U.K. native told Variety after <a href=#>the first installment of episodes dropped</a> in June 2022. “I mean, I wouldn’t speak to people. I wouldn’t speak to anybody outside of the Stranger Things world for at least four days before filming anything.”</p><p>The musician recalled <a href=#>doing some “pretty wild stuff” to get into character as Vecna</a>. “If anyone saw me walking around the streets of Atlanta at 2 o’clock in the morning talking to myself, they would understand. I was just bringing up a lot of anger, particularly for Vecna,” he shared.</p><p>The experience also <a href=#>brought out “scary” moments for the actor</a> to deal with. “Particularly when I’m Henry or One, there’s so much manipulation that’s going on in there,” Bower added at the time. “To work with a young person or a child or somebody who’s much younger, that was an interesting dynamic. And the things that would sort of pop up in the brain were quite weird and odd.”</p><p>His costar <a href=#><strong>Millie Bobby Brown</strong></a> also had her own process of becoming Eleven. After originally shaving her head for the role, the Emmy nominee <a href=#>opted out of undergoing such a personal transformation for season 4.</a></p><p>Stylist <strong>Sarah Hindsgaul</strong> broke down <a href=#>the process of creating a fake buzz cut for Brown</a>, writing via Instagram in June 2022, “The most important is a tight wrap of her own hair so her head shape is as natural as possible with no bulk. For that we wetted her hair down and slicked it with a gel tight to her head placing her hair in a flattering manner.”</p><p>Hindsgaul continued: “Afterwards her head would be wrapped tightly in an elastic material and we would put her under the heat to dry for 15 min. I cut the wig down short, comb over scissors, after that, I buzzed it on an open 3/5 guard. This is by far the hardest wig challenge I have ever been given.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The crew member <a href=#>praised Brown for collaborating on the process</a>, adding, “Millie my love thank you the most for always trusting me, you have my heart forever and ever.”</p><p>Scroll down to see what the stars of Stranger Things look like in real life:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BowbOtzaCcq2Wknbavs9JmmpqrpGLEqa3TZquhnV2owaK%2B0majqKebYrmqt8RmoKdlopqurXnLop2eZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
