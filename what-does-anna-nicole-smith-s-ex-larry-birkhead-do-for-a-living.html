The pair <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">take time to remember Anna Nicole in special ways</a>, but their life isn't all about grieving.</p><p>In fact, they have a pretty quiet life, and that's the way Birkhead likes it. Especially after rumors swirled over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dannielynn possibly inheriting millions from her mom</a>!</p><h2 id=what-is-dannielynn-birkhead-s-net-worth>What Is Dannielynn Birkhead's Net Worth?</h2><p>It's understandable if fans think that Larry is riding high on his daughter's inheritance from her mom. But that seems to not be the case. In fact, Larry and his little girl <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have a combined net worth of about $3 million</a>.</p><p>The cash is nothing to scoff at, of course, but it's not enough to rely on for the rest of Larry's (or Dannielynn's) life. So, fans&nbsp;do have to wonder: what exactly does Larry do for a living?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-anna-nicole-s-ex-do>What Does Anna Nicole's Ex Do?</h2><p>While Anna Nicole Smith has a long list of interesting exes, Birkhead might be the most fascinating. When he and Anna Nicole met, it was at the Kentucky Dirby, a venue that Larry has often returned to with his daughter.</p><p>But the former couple's whirlwind romance wasn't the only thing that happened at the Derby. After all, Larry was there working, as a celebrity photographer!</p><p>Birkhead has long been a freelance celebrity photographer, according to multiple sources, but recent reports also suggest <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has continued to work in both photography and house flipping</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Larry also has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lengthy IMDb history</a> that includes multiple TV appearances to discuss his late partner and his daughter, plus reality TV shows and documentaries. Larry even appeared on 'Vanderpump Rules' and joined 'Celebrity Wife Swap' for an episode.</p><p>That's not all, though. In addition to all his entertainment industry pursuits, Larry also has a side gig that fans seem to endorse: he sells Anna Nicole merch.</p><p>Though some fans might give Larry the side-eye for selling Anna Nicole-themed shirts,&nbsp;most are appreciative. After all, the late model and actress still has plenty of followers around the world, and they're keen to watch Dannielynn grow up&nbsp;and&nbsp;support the dad-daughter duo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It also makes sense that Larry retains some rights to Anna Nicole's image, given that he's raising their daughter. And apart from his day jobs, it seems Larry's found another way to ensure his daughter has a comfortable life.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Was Anna Nicole Smith's First Husband?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp6aRYruqr86lnGarnZ7BqXnEsWSwoJGpeqW7xKxkpZmip8ZursiroqGdkZl6pbuO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
