First venturing into the world of<strong> modeling</strong> while still in high school, Jackie worked for major clothing companies as a model until<strong> transitioning to the world of feature film </strong>in 1999.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Catching the eye of Rob Schneider, Jackie would find herself landing a small role in the 1999 hit<strong> Deuce Bigalow. </strong>Schneider would be instrumental in the Titone and Sandler meeting. Which leads us to…</p><h2 id=how-did-jackie-and-adam-sandler-meet><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Did Jackie And Adam Sandler Meet?</span></h2><p><strong>Adam Sandler’s </strong>films range from the wacky to the restrained (somewhat) but always maintain that Happy Madison vibe, regardless of the subject. While the comedic actor has a place for all his films in his heart, one in particular likely stands out among the rest: <strong>Big Daddy</strong>.<strong> </strong>On the set of 1999’s<strong> Big Daddy</strong>, Adam’s life would change forever (and for the better), as the Billy Madison actor<strong> would meet Jackie </strong>for the first time. Friend and fellow SNL star Rob Schneider would send Jackie the way of Sandler, with Sandler casting the up-and-coming actress. Portraying a waitress, Jackie would “serve” a hefty dose of what lay in wait for the actor (nice, right?)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Is Taylor Lautner In So Many Adam Sandler Movies?</a></span></p><h2 id=adam-and-jackie-sandler-39-s-relationship-is-20-years-strong><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Adam And Jackie Sandler's Relationship Is 20 Years Strong</span></h2><p>Marriage in Hollywood can sometimes seem like a trending fad or a spur of the moment lark to alleviate boredom. However, some of these Hollywood marriages do stand the test of time and happen for all the right reasons. Such is the case for Jackie and Adam Sandler. <strong>Jackie </strong>and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Adam </strong>would<strong> join in holy matrimony</strong> in a traditional Jewish ceremony on June 22, 2003</a>. The ceremony was held at Dick Clark’s mansion in Malibu, and among the 400 guests in attendance, many were of the star variety, such as Jack Nicholson and Rob Schneider to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sandler took to IG to post this message regarding his long-time wife and lady love, “22 years ago today we locked eyes and fell deep. Look forward to the next 22, young lady. Love you, my forever girl.” Doesn’t get any sweeter than that, does it?</p><h2 id=jackie-sandler-has-made-many-appearances-in-adam-sandler-rsquo-s-movies><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jackie Sandler Has Made Many Appearances In Adam Sandler’s Movies</span></h2><p>Big Daddy is hardly the only film to feature Mrs. Sandler. Indeed, the actress has appeared in a myriad of the Click star’s movies. <strong>Jackie</strong> has shown up in everything from<strong> </strong><strong>Pixels</strong>, <strong>Hotel Transylvania </strong>and <strong>Little Nicky</strong> to the more grounded <strong>Home Team</strong> and <strong>Paul Blart: Mall Cop </strong>(the last one was meant to be a joke, you see?). That dynamic can be an interesting one – staring alongside or producing films with your wife – but Adam sees it as a shared process. During an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Adam said this about sharing the screen with his wife, as well as the decision process for his films, “We do this together, me and Jackie. Movies, you know, we discuss what I’m gonna to do. And she gives me, you know, strength and courage to jump into this stuff.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Adam Sandler Got Himself In Mortal Danger</a></span></p><h2 id=the-sandler-children-are-being-raised-jewish><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Sandler Children Are Being Raised Jewish</span></h2><p>It stands to reason that the <strong>Sandler children</strong> would be <strong>raised Jewish</strong>. After all, Jackie converted to Judaism long before their birth. For the most part, <strong>Sadie</strong> and<strong> Sunny Sandler </strong>have been kept out of the spotlight (which is quite the feat nowadays) and are being raised privately. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the children have managed to pop up in a few of their father’s films</a>, making appearances in such films as, Hubie Halloween, Bedtime Stories, Grown Ups, Grown Ups 2, Jack and Jill, and Blended. Though the kids have a nice jump start on their acting careers, <a href=#>whether dear old dad is encouraging his two kids to become actors</a> is another story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jackie-sandler-39-s-conversion-came-before-their-marriage><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jackie Sandler's Conversion Came Before Their Marriage</span></h2><p><strong>Jackie</strong> would<strong> convert to Judaism in 2000</strong>, before the couple were married (in a traditional Jewish ceremony). Feeling the conversion was the<strong> first major step</strong> before the couple married and seeing it as a gesture of how <strong>serious the relationship was becoming</strong>, Jackie traded her crucifix for a yarmulke and said mazel tov before walking down the aisle to join her husband to be. By no means a small feat, changing religion often means a complete overhaul of what you may be accustomed to in life. A major step indeed.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Who Replaced Adam Sandler in Hotel Transylvania: Transformania?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdlrGiuYysmKecnJq%2FbsPIn5xmm5%2Bjw6a%2B056bZqyfYre2sMCiqqZn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
