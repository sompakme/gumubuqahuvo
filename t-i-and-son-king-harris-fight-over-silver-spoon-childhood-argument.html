And Son King Harris Fight Over &amp;quot;Silver Spoon&amp;quot; Childhood Argument</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-03</div><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_t-i data-tag=t-i>T.I.</a> and his son <a href=# id=auto-tag_king-harris data-tag=king-harris>King Harris</a> were involved in a heated argument regarding the teenager’s “silver spoon” upbringing, an exchange that ultimately turned into a physical altercation between the two.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On Sunday (Nov. 26), while <a href=#>the Harris family</a> were in attendance at the Atlanta Falcons’ divisional matchup against the New Orleans Saints, T.I. and King began disagreeing over the latter’s privileged childhood. In a clip that surfaced on social media, T.I. questions his son about his experience of being subjected to poor living conditions while growing up, such as roach-infested homes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“King, have you ever woke up with a roach on your face,” the Bankhead rep can be heard asking, before insisting that his son’s claims are off base. “Alright then! You don’t know what you talking ’bout,” the veteran rap star added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1815098903.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Undeterred, King offered to show T.I., his mother, Tiny Harris, and others in the room a presumable drug den in a neighborhood he frequents as proof of his<a href=#> affiliation with the streets</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Do y’all wanna go to the bando in my neighborhood,” he asks before accusing T.I. of lying in an attempt to bolster his public image. “To make him look better, he say sh*t that he know not true,” King says, again shunning the notion that he was sheltered and protected as a child. “Silver spoon? I ain’t never ate with that a day in my life.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Tiny then chimed in, telling King he did have a silver spoon, with King interjecting by claiming that he often spent time at his grandmother’s house as opposed to his parents’ home and often got “into fights” as a child. “I don’t wanna be in these gates, I wanna be outside in the neighborhood,” the teenager said of his mind-state at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-827525640.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">King’s parents continued to point out <a href=#>his childish habits</a>, alleging that he “cried like a baby” to be with his grandmother and would “hold [his] breath and throw tantrums” in order to get his way. Adding insult to injury, Tiny revealed that King’s grandmother would allow him to “suck a pacifier until he was 12 years old,” an accusation he didn’t deny, but insists is only part of the story.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“They ain’t gonna tell you everything. They trying to hide it, sugarcoat it,” he said of his parents, particularly his father. “He capping. He know I stand on business, he know that. Ain’t no n*gga ever pull my card ever in life, I stand on business. You drop me in your hood, I stand on business. You wanna hide it for the world, I’ma put it out there for them to see.” King continued, adding “You ain’t have me put up nowhere, ni**a. You ain’t have me behind a mansion, I was outside doing what I wanted do.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">King then attributed his parents’ claims to being under the influence, becoming increasingly agitated as his mother attempted to step in and calm him down, accusing her of allowing T.I. to disrespect him.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Why you letting him play me like that” King asks as Tiny can be seen separating him from T.I., who eventually grabs his son and places him in a headlock as King struggles to free himself from the hold.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1742940533-e1706807013937.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">King demanded that his father let him go, however T.I. began to chastise his son for his “embarrassing” statements while telling King he’s physically outmatched and at his mercy. “You are embarrassing yourself and your family! Boy, you can’t do nothing with me! Ain’t sh*t you can do with me!” he says while others attempt to diffuse the altercation before the clip ends.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Later that day, King took to his Instagram to continue to seemingly lash out at his father, although he didn’t mention T.I. by name. “I Stand on. BUSINESS DONT GIVE A F**K WHO U ARE … IDGAF WHO U ARE MF CANT PLAY WIT ME N MY FACE NOT GOIN FOR DA IM A GROWN A** MAN NOW,” he wrote.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The teen then alluded to being told his birth was a “mistake” while again accusing his father of fabricating an image. “If ima mistake say dat stop making da world think u fw me when u DONT. Ni**a be faking a image for da internet &. It AINT Me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">King Harris’ Instagram posts were later deleted.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See footage of T.I. and King Harris’ argument and altercation below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6l6qnnKoqWgZZiWv7O10madop%2BYqXqwwsSrZKyhnKuys3nSqaaopl2Ytaq4w6GmqJxdlr%2Bowcyepa1lYWeAdYSRa2dubV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
