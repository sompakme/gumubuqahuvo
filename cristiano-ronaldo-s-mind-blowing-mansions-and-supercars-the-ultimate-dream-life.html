Surrounded by lush green gardens and breathtaking mountain views, this Italian villa offers a comfortable and luxurious lifestyle fit for the king of the field and his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With an approximate value of $6.5 million, his artistic manor home is equipped with the finest quality furniture, a modern private gym, an on site spa, and a swimming pool.

In addition to a stunning exterior and enviable location in the heart of the city, the Manhattan condo offers a custom artistic flair introduced by globally famous designer Juan Pablo Molyneux.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Previously owned by former President Donald Trump’s business partner, Ronaldo's condo appeared to be a wise investment and complement to his portfolio of property. While Ronaldo sold the condo at a loss in late 2022, he still <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">walked away with over $7 million</a> from the sale of the Trump Tower property.</p><h2 id=wheels-that-turn-heads><strong>Wheels That Turn Heads</strong></h2><p>When we talk about Cristiano Ronaldo and his riches, it's impossible not to mention his notable collection of cars. His menagerie of luxury cars is vast and impressive, especially the crown jewels of his collection: a Bugatti La Voiture Noire, a Rolls-Royce Phantom, and a Lamborghini Aventador. His extravagant car collection reflects his impeccable taste, and they remain a point of interest for his hundreds of millions of fans worldwide.</p><h2 id=bugatti-la-voiture-noire><strong>Bugatti La Voiture Noire</strong></h2><p>Bugattis are considered among the most luxurious and expensive cars in the world, and Ronaldo owns four of them – including a Bugatti La Voiture Noire worth 8.5 million Euros.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, CR7’s collection of Bugattis includes a Bugatti Chiron, a Bugatti Centodieci, and a Bugatti Veyron, with an approximate total cost of $13.2 million.

And when it comes to Ronaldo, he owns two of them: the Rolls-Royce Phantom and Rolls-Royce Cullinan, with a total cost of approximately $1.3 million.</p><p>At least one of his Rolls-Royce vehicles was a gift from his partner, ringing up at around $370,000.</p><h2 id=bentleys-plural><strong>Bentleys (Plural)</strong></h2><p>With a total cost of around $532,000, the Al Nassr star has acquired two of the most appealing Bentleys, including the Bentley Continental GT and Bentley Flying Spur.</p><p>As we've observed before, <a href=#>Bentleys are the epitome of quiet luxury</a>. Even in pairs.</p><h2 id=a-lamborghini-aventador><strong>A Lamborghini Aventador</strong></h2><p>The Lamborghini Aventador is famed for its unique and extravagant appearance, and Ronaldo has furnished his garage with this $318,000 beast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ronaldo has been spotted many times with his girlfriend, driving his coveted Lamborghini Aventador on the roads and enjoying the breeze. In contrast with his Bentleys, the Lamborghini Aventador could be considered an example of "loud luxury" – but it nevertheless is an impressive vehicle that always turns heads.</p><h2 id=mclaren-senna><strong>McLaren Senna</strong></h2><p>Named after the famed Brazilian Formula One driver Ayrton Senna (in an exclusive partnership with the McLaren brand) a McLaren Senna costs a whopping $1 million apiece – a price tag that's perhaps less prohibitive for football legends. The model was specifically designed to "achieve faster lap times" in races, matching Ronaldo's speed on the pitch.</p><p>The five-time Ballon d’Or winner's taste in luxury vehicles is diverse, and the McLaren Senna is just one of the impressive fleet in his garage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=furious-ferraris><strong>Furious Ferraris</strong></h2><p>To complete this luxurious lineup, let’s talk about Ferraris. Master of the field and slayer of hearts, Cristiano Ronaldo has three fantastic Ferraris. They include the Ferrari F430, the Ferrari 599 GTB, and the Ferrari 599 GTO, with an approximate total cost of about $995,000.</p><p>Here’s where it gets interesting: Ronaldo could have owned one more Ferrari, but legend has it that the Maestro once lost a bidding battle to his field rival <a href=#>Lionel Messi</a> in a heated rush to purchase a Ferrari 355 S Spider Scaglietti.</p><h2 id=living-the-ultimate-dream><strong>Living The Ultimate Dream</strong></h2><p>The collection of Cristiano Ronaldo’s cozy villas and luxurious cars goes to show that if you’re dedicated to your craft, just make up your mind and start moving forward.
