New York is a city where the average apartment rent - for a decent place - is over $4,500 per month. A sugar baby is a young person who looks to have an arrangement with an older, wealthier person that can help pay the bills. These arrangements can be either platonic or sexual depending on the interests of both parties. A sugar baby is helped financially by a Sugar Daddy (wealthy male) or a Sugar Momma (wealthy female) in exchange for the attentions of the Sugar Baby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Via Sugar Momma Club</p><p>Websites like Sugar Momma Club,&nbsp;Seeking&nbsp;Arrangement,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sugar Daddy&nbsp;assist those who have an interest in “sugaring.” Estimates are that there are about 6 to 10 million sugar babies looking for patronage from about two million sugar daddies/mommas. Most of the sugar babies are in their twenties. Sugar daddies and mommas are affluent and usually in their mid-fifties or older with money to spare to help out a younger person.</p><p>As reported by <a href=#>i-d.vice.com</a>, quite a few “creatives” are seeking such arrangements in order to follow their interests in the arts. Many people are able to start careers, such as fashion design, music, or acting, that in the past had necessitated being a "starving artist" first. Many times the sugar babies are looking for help paying tuition for studies at expensive universities for law school, fashion design, the arts, or filmmaking. Rather than take out massive student loans with little hope of ever being able to pay them back, they prefer to do sugaring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The average support for those that seek financial help from the very affluent is around $2,500 per month. That can pay half the rent on a shared apartment in NYC and goes a long way towards paying college tuition. For those outside of the major metropolitan areas, the support may be more modest. The websites for sugaring cater to sugar babies, daddies, and mommas all over the world. In other countries, the support for the sugar babies may be much more modest as the cost of living is much less in those areas. Some sugar babies seek a permanent relationship or marriage in order to leave a poorer country for&nbsp;a wealthier one.</p><p>Sugaring is not illegal in the United States and many other countries because it differs from prostitution, as typically there is no direct exchange of sex for money. The sugar babies receive gifts of support that might include payment of college tuition or rent and/or deposits of cash into their bank accounts. Good Sugar Daddies and Mommas are very generous, therefore there is little need to charge or pay by the hour. That would ruin the whole experience for both parties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most of the relationships include sex as part of the arrangement but it is not always a requirement and may be an incidental part of the experience after spending lots of time together. Some Sugar Daddies and Mommas simply enjoy the company of a younger person without needing to have sex be part of the relationship.</p><p>Some sugar babies seek mentors that are working in their areas of career interest. In those cases, the contacts and introductions made by the sugar daddies and mommas may actually be more valuable than any cash received by the sugar babies.</p><p>One thing that is interesting about these arrangements is that on both sides the deal is understood and the activities included are very specific. There are rarely any surprises and there is a great deal of openness encouraged by the online systems to be explicit about what a person is exactly looking for, in order to enjoy the most pleasant arrangement possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is not for everyone; however, it is certainly becoming more popular and there is much less of a taboo regarding these things than there was before.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3y0wcaaqWaakZfGbrDAnZuyZZGnv6K6xp6knqakqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
