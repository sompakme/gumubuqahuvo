Alexis Adams had a sit-down interview with The Daily Mail, in which she details the “Dancer” musician’s distance and aversion to their 19-month-old son, Zohar Paxton. Zohar was born with hydrocephalus, a neurological condition in which fluid builds up in the skull and causes the brain to swell. It is often referred to as “water on the brain."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Zohar was born with&nbsp;hydrocephalus, a neurological condition in which fluid builds up in the skull and causes the brain to swell. It is often referred to as “water on the brain.”</p><p>According to Adams, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Florida MC</a> initially denied that Zohar was his son, and after the paternity results proved otherwise, Flo has only seen him once. While the rapper&nbsp;(real name Tramar Dillard) helps assist with the toddler’s medical fees, he does not make an effort to see his son.</p><p>“[<a href=# id=auto-tag_flo-rida_1 data-tag=flo-rida>Flo Rida</a>]&nbsp;kept his shades on and his back turned,” said Adams of Flo’s initial meeting with the child. “They were in the same room. He didn’t try to hug Zohar, nothing. It was very cold.”</p><p>Adams also alleges that when she told the “Sweet Sensation” musician that she was pregnant, he urged her to get an abortion and hurled insults at the unborn child.</p><p>“He called my baby ‘an evil f**king child.’ Those were his exact words,” she claims. “Flo Rida was aware of how high-risk my pregnancy was and he is entirely aware of Zohar’s condition. He does not want any involvement…If it was up to Flo Rida, he would allow the government to take care of his&nbsp;son.”</p><p>Flo Rida, who also experienced&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">baby mama drama</a> with another woman in 2014, has not responded to the reports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5u5sHnRopuaZZSewKKuy56bZqufo3p2hJVpa21n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
