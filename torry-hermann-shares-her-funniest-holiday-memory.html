In 19 hours, I'm already in a taxi to the hospital where she is supposedly giving birth."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'The Housewives Of The North Pole' Exclusive: Kyle Richards On What She's Most Excited For Fans To See</a></span></p><h2 id=plot-twist-2-torry-39-s-friend-had-already-given-birth-before-her-arrival-but-that-39-s-not-all>Plot Twist 2: Torry's Friend Had Already Given Birth Before Her Arrival...But That's Not All!</h2><p>Thinking back on her arrival at the hospital, Torry shares, <strong>"I see her husband and parents when I run in, and he says that they did a c-section" </strong>- meaning that despite her best efforts, she'd still missed the birth.</p><p>However, that's not all:<strong> "because there were some complications and a possibility of infection, nobody can go inside to see her."</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 10 Christmas Movies Of The 2000s, Ranked According to IMDb</a></span></p><p><strong>"Basically,"</strong> she continues, <strong>"we all waited in the hospital for a few more hours, but because she was under anesthesia, we were not able to come in."</strong></p><p><strong>"So," </strong>she half-sighs, half-laughs, <strong>"we went to her house, had dinner...and the next morning, I flew back to Canada!"</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=as-with-every-good-christmas-story-this-one-has-a-great-ending>As With Every Good Christmas Story, This One Has A Great Ending</h2><p>From Home Alone to The Night Before, many of the world's best-loved Christmas movies are centered on misadventure - but they all have one thing in common: a happy ending. Torry's story is no exception to this rule.</p><p><strong>"When my best friend recovered and her husband was finally able to see her, she told him, 'you won't believe it, but I swear I heard Victoria's annoying voice! It was a dream, but it seemed so real...like she was right here'."</strong></p><p>The cruel irony, a Christmas conundrum, festive folly - however one chooses to frame this, no one can deny that Christmas 2014 was a memorable one for Torry Hermann.</p><p>As a side note, we're sure no one would be opposed to Torry recreating the Christmas that could have been as her very first Holiday film!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>EXCLUSIVE: Noella Bergener Reveals Her Favorite Christmas Memory</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsZucqsCqwsRmq6iqoq56qbHRppinpl2dvK21w5qwZpuYp7a0wMyaqmaepaO7qrHSrWSmnZ2kv7p506KiraebYsawwdOumZ5lmaPAta3Gq5imZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
