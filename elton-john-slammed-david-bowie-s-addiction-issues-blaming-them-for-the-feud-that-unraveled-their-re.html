As a result, it makes sense that even <a href=#>Joe Jonas once had to deny being an addict</a> and reveal more about his personal life.</p><p>On top of music stars partying, feuds among performers pop up all the time. One example of that is the fact that <a href=#>Elton John and Tina Turner once feuded</a>. Similarly, John also once feuded with David Bowie. However, John has stated that Bowie's addiction issues played a role in their fight.</p><h2 id=david-bowie-publicly-insulted-elton-john-in-an-interview>David Bowie Publicly Insulted Elton John In An Interview</h2><p>In January 1976, David Bowie released his album "Station to Station" which featured songs like "Golden Years". A few weeks after that album was released, Rolling Stone published an article featuring their interview with the rock star. During his conversation with that publication, Bowie, seemingly out of nowhere, threw an insult at Elton John.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-bowie-wearing-a-white-suit.jpg><p>While he spoke to Rolling Stone, Bowie began expressing his opinion of rock and roll music at that time. Like most people, Bowie thought that his generation's version of rock and roll was a perversion of the idolized version of what came before them.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What were David Bowie's biggest hit songs before 1977</a>, according to Billboard?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Song Title:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Highest It Charted:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>"Fame"</p></td><td><p>#1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Golden Years"</p></td><td><p>#10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Space Oddity"</p></td><td><p>#15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Young Americans"</p></td><td><p>#28</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Changes"</p></td><td><p>#41</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"TVC15"</p></td><td><p>#64</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Starman"</p></td><td><p>#65</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"The Jean Genie"</p></td><td><p>#71</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Rock & roll has been really bringing me down lately.

Bowie also returned to the topic of rock and roll. Bowie even surprisingly brought up the belief that there is something evil about rock and roll.</p><p>"You don’t have a fucking chance to hear Beethoven on any radio station anymore. You’ve got to listen to the O’Jays. I mean, disco music is great. I used disco to get my first Number One single [“Fame”] but it’s an escapist’s way out. It’s musical soma. Rock & roll too — it will occupy and destroy you that way. It lets in lower elements and shadows that I don’t think are necessary. Rock has always been the devil’s music. You can’t convince me that it isn’t.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/did-matt-leblanc-ever-feud-with-david-schwimmer-and-matthew-perry-during-their-time-on-friends_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Did Matt LeBlanc Ever Feud With David Schwimmer And Matthew Perry During Their Time On Friends?">Did Matt LeBlanc Ever Feud With David Schwimmer And Matthew Perry During Their Time On Friends?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer portrayed best friends but they may not have gotten along all the time behind the scenes.</p><p>In response to Bowie's comments, Rolling Stone's interviewer asked him something surprising. "How about specifics? Is Mick Jagger evil?" Bowie completely dismissed the idea that Mick Jagger was evil by comparing him to Elton John. It is easy to see why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John would have been extremely insulted by what Bowie said about him</a>.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Five musicians that didn't get along with David Bowie</a>, according to Far Out Magazine.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Keith Richards</strong></li><li><strong>Axl Rose</strong></li><li><strong>Elton John</strong></li><li><strong>Frank Zappa</strong></li><li><strong>Gary Numan</strong></li></ul><p>“Mick himself?

According to John, that may have been because Bowie was under the influence when he made that remark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/elton-john-looking-defiant-behind-a-piano.jpg><p>Thanks to the success John enjoyed and his years of partying, it would be an understatement to say he's led a fascinating life. Fortunately for John's fans and the world, he has given fans a window into his life on several occasions.</p><p>In 2019, John provided his fans with the ultimate chance to get to know him and his life better. That year, John released his autobiography, "Me". As a part of John's autobiography, he wrote about his history with several stars, including David Bowie.</p><p>According to what John wrote in his book, he was never close friends with Bowie. John elaborated by explaining that he socialized with Bowie a handful of times but that the two of them never bonded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/how-ava-sambora-managed-to-stay-out-of-the-spotlight-despite-her-parents-heather-locklear-and-richie-sambora-both-struggling-with-very-public-addiction-issues.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Ava Sambora Managed To Stay Out Of The Spotlight Despite Her Parents Heather Locklear And Richie Sambora Struggling With Public Addiction Issues">Ava Sambora Managed To Stay Out Of The Spotlight Despite Her Parents Heather Locklear And Richie Sambora Struggling With Public Addiction Issues</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Ava Sambora has avoided the addiction pitfalls her famous parents Heather Locklear and Richie Sambora have fallen into.</p><p>"I was never great friends with Bowie. I loved his music and we socialised a couple of times, visiting the Sombrero with Tony King and having dinner together in Covent Garden while he was rehearsing for the Ziggy Stardust tour. But there was always something distant and aloof about him, at least when I was around."</p><p>During a 2016 interview with The Evening Standard, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elton John spoke about once being friends with David Bowie</a> . "David [Bowie] and I were not the best of friends towards the end. We started out being really good friends. We used to hang out together with Marc Bolan, going to gay clubs, but I think we just drifted apart."</p><p>While he reflected on his inability to be friends with John, Bowie was very open about what went wrong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/elton-john-tried-suing-his-accounting-firm-for-30-million-but-instead-lost-12-million-of-his-fortune.jpg><p>"I honestly don't know what the problem was, but there clearly was a problem."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As John has explained during other interviews, he and Bowie were not close by the time the "Fame" singer passed away.
