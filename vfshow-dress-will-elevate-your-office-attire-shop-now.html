Some of Us may be excited for the social aspect of office culture — but not as pumped about getting dressed in professional attire on the regular. That said, we’re taking it as an opportunity to pick up some new looks and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">come back in style</a>!</p><p>Whether you’re sitting pretty at the same job or starting a new role, returning to the office is an opportunity to make an impression. You can go simple and rock a pair of comfy legging-style pants and a gorgeous blouse — or you can fully embrace the conference-chic look while wearing a sleek pencil dress <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">like this one from Vfshow</a>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Vfshow-Womens-Front-Zipper-Slim-Pencil-Dress.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vfshow Women’s Front Zipper Slim Pencil Dress</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$36</a> at Amazon!

This dress is effortlessly glamorous, understated and totally flattering! Though it is a more fitted dress that shows off your figure, it’s still modest and professional enough for it to be appropriate for any office environment. Shoppers love the way this dress looks on them, and also note how comfortable it feels. Bonus!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Vfshow-Womens-Front-Zipper-Slim-Pencil-Dress-2.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vfshow Women’s Front Zipper Slim Pencil Dress</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$36</a> at Amazon!

Another feature that we love is the waist-slimming, criss-cross stitching at the center of the dress. It makes you look cinched in and creates a gorgeous silhouette! As mentioned, it is more fitted — but it’s not a full bodycon piece. The skirt isn’t as skintight towards the bottom, allowing for a more relaxed vibe. We also love that the zipper on the neckline can be kept up during the day, and moved lower at night to show a little extra skin.
