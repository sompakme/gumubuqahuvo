The actor acquired the property in 2013 for $2.2 million</p><p>The home is situated in Coconut Grove, a luxe Miami neighbourhood. The Italian-inspired home comes with 4 bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms, and spans more than 3,200 square feet.</p><p>Some of its main features include a huge master suite, a rooftop terrace, and a detached guest house featuring its own bathroom and bedroom. It also has outdoor amenities, including a pool. During his time living at there, Christian renovated the kitchen, master bathroom, and guest suite.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite its short tenure on the market, the home was the subject of a bidding war before it was sold, explaining why it went over asking so quickly.</p><p>Christian was represented by Hogan and Charles Celesia of Compass. Speaking to <a href=#>The Real Deal</a>, Hogan revealed that over 60 prospective buyers toured the home over the three days.</p><p>“We were able to leverage his name to get more eyes on the property,” the real estate agent explained, “That definitely helped drive the price.”</p><p>Eventually, there were three interested buyers who attempted to outbid each other to buy the home. The buyer is described as a “Florida company managed by Veronica Silva, Rocio Delgado, Armando Lema and Maria Friedman, all tied to a Deerfield Beach address,” the publication explains.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The sale was likely sealed last month, as it was initially reported in early July that Christian had listed the estate. Christian is reportedly relocating from Florida to Los Angeles and New York for work, but it’s unclear if he’s in the market for a new property.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Rick Ross’ Wingstop Chain Fined For Skimming Employee Wages</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>The Real Deal</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmacoKKewLW1wKdkrKSRqbKzv4ymoJqlmWK1sLnEZqqopJRis7C%2BjGpnZqemmr9urdKkoKefXZ67brbUrKtma12Zrrq%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
