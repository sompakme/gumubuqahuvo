Aye. Spanish, Spanish, Spanish. Why do you dress like a boy? Disgusting.” She further explained that she loves to take her full-sized underwear and have it hang out of her pants a little to bother her larger-than-life co-star. And it worked! “She’d go, ‘that is disgusting,’” Bowen tells Us.</p><p>And then the mother of three&nbsp;let us in on this loving, sisterly tidbit: Sofia has her own line of seamless <a href=#>underwear called Eby</a> that she was secretly leaving for Julie in her dressing room. “I thought the wardrobe department&nbsp;was leaving them for me, because they always leave you a thong, because that’s what you’re supposed to be wearing under the skirt. So I just thought they were leaving me, I don’t know … underwear. And then one day I realize it’s Sofia’s underwear line.”</p><p>But of course Sofi had a secondary ulterior motive that is absolutely hilarious. “She goes, ‘Yes, I need somebody with a really tiny butt to try the small size and tell me how they fit.’ I was like, ‘And I’m the tiny butt model?’&nbsp;She’s like, ‘Yes.’ They’re great, though. I do wear them now, under skirts with the lines, but not on the pants.”</p><p>It should come as no surprise that Bowen is so into Eby.&nbsp;The seamless undies subscription service,&nbsp;which costs $16 a month,&nbsp;provides tech-enhanced panties with a cotton lining that doesn’t&nbsp;slide, effectively banishing pantylines. Even better: they are priced affordably and sized to fit a range between XS-4X.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Whether you’re her costar or a regular lady, Sofia Vergara just wants you to wear cute, comfortable and flattering undies.</p><p>For the latest beauty and style trends subscribe to our new podcast ‘Get Tressed With Us’ below!<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2FCrbXEZpmor5WjerixwKuqZqufm7aiedWeqaCZopbAbsHNnZyrr5WWv264yKecZp2SrnqlsdOaoKWrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
