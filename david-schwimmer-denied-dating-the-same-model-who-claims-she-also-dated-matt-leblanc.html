Due to his Ross character on television, fans assumed the actor was easy to approach, and that tends to be the case for lots of other actors and actresses. However, David reveals that his relationships took a hit, and that he was constantly trying to hide.</p><p>“It was pretty jarring and it messed with my relationship to other people in a way that took years, I think, for me to kind of adjust to and become comfortable with. As an actor, the way I was trained, my job was to observe life and to observe other people, and so I used to walk around with my head up, and really engaged and watching people," Global News quotes Schwimmer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continues, “The effect of celebrity was the absolute opposite. “It made me want to hide under a baseball cap, not be seen. And I realized after a while that I was no longer watching people; I was trying to hide. So I was trying to figure out: How do I be an actor in this new world, in this new situation? How do I do my job? So that was tricky.”</p><p>As for his past relationships, Schwimmer married Zoe Buckman in 2010 and the former couple had a daughter a year later. They split in 2017. It would appear as though the popular sitcom star is currently single.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXq0r8ewoKallad6pbHNopydZZSWwaq6xmaZq5membZus8uapa%2BhnKGybsPHqGScpJGeurR50qGcZpmcqLxusMCtnJ1lnZbBtXnLnpmlmZ6YfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
