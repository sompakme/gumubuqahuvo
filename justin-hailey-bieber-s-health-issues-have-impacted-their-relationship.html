It can result in a skin rash, hearing loss, and facial paralysis. <a href=#>Justin cancelled several upcoming tour dates</a> as a result of the recent diagnosis. Luckily, Hailey said her husband has been doing well and improving following the diagnosis.</p><p>"He is getting better every single day,” she said. “He's feeling a lot better. Obviously, it was just a very scary and random situation to happen, but he's going to be totally okay and I'm just grateful that he's fine."</p><p>The model added that Justin feels encouraged thanks to the large amount of support he’s received since going public with the diagnosis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In March, Hailey dealt with her own health scare after she experienced a mini stroke following a blood clot. She had to undergo surgery as a result. But like Justin, Hailey says she’s been doing a lot better since the health scare.</p><p>"You know, I had a procedure done to close this hole in my heart, and I'm just giving my body the time to heal and recover," Hailey told GMA. "It was a little hard for me to recover from the procedure, just giving myself the time to be able to, like, work out again and feel, like, normal if that makes sense. But I'm doing well now, and I'm not having to be on any medication anymore. So, I feel good."</p><p>Hailey previously explained in a YouTube video she believes the <a href=#>blood clot was caused by a combination</a> of contracting COVID-19, frequent, long international flights, and starting birth control without a doctor’s permission.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>E!
