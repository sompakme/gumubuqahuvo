"A whole part of this conversation that Billie's not talking about is how Taylor has completely resurrected a dead industry. You can’t be the best at everything: you can’t be the most sustainable and be resurrecting industries and be a titan of industry."</p><p>Something else they criticized was the 22-year-old singer wearing the "Artists for Ceasefire" pin, saying she shouldn't get involved in politics.
