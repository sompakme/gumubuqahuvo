The teens sat down with <a href=#>The New York Times' T Magazine</a>, and gave some stereotypically bizarre quotes.</p><p>Expounding on everything from their disregard for traditional schooling to their apparent ability to bend time, the Smiths shared some unforgettable words. Below, the five wildest quotes from the <a href=#>T interview</a>.</p><p><strong>Jaden on the concept of time</strong>: "It's proven that how time moves for you depends on where you are in the universe. It's relative to beings and other places. But on the level of being here on earth, if you are aware in a moment, one second can last a year. And if you are unaware, your whole childhood, your whole life can pass by in six seconds. But it's also such a thing that you can get lost in… because you have to live. There's a theoretical physicist inside all of our minds, and you can talk and talk, but it's living."</p><p><strong>Willow on the themes that recur in her work:</strong> "The feeling of being like, this is a fragment of a holographic reality that a higher consciousness made."</p><p><strong>Jaden on education: </strong>"Here's the deal: School is not authentic because it ends. It's not true, it's not real. Our learning will never end. The school that we go to every single morning, we will continue to go to."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Willow on her growth:</strong> "Caring less what everybody else thinks, but also caring less and less about what your own mind thinks, because what your own mind thinks, sometimes, is the thing that makes you sad."</p><p><strong>Jaden on his life plan: </strong>"I have a goal to be just the most craziest person of all time. And when I say craziest, I mean, like, I want to do like Olympic-level things. I want to be the most durable person on the planet."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoZyhvLh5wKebZqKRmbKvedKmoK2go2LBbrnAoJizoZ6aeqq6056pr6GVrHqntdWeZJyqka%2B2pr%2FTZqiup6SawG5%2Bj2pranBhZnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
