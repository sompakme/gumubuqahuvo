Both Wonders and Keery were dressed appropriately for the chilly fall weather, with the Bodies, Bodies, Bodies star donning jeans, a black puffy coat and a gray wrap around her head."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The twosome walked arm in arm while taking a stroll in the Big Apple, stopping a few times to look at Wonders’ phone <a href=#>and share a laugh</a>.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>Both Wonders and Keery were dressed appropriately for the chilly fall weather, with the Bodies, Bodies, Bodies star donning jeans, a black puffy coat and a gray wrap around her head. Keery, meanwhile, sported dark denim, a blue and yellow sweater and a navy blazer paired with a matching beanie. The duo both kept it low-key by each rocking a pair of sunglasses.</p><p>Wonders’ day with Keery comes two months after she and Davidson, 29, called it quits for good <a href=#>following less than one year of dating</a>.</p><p>“There’s no bad blood or any hard feelings between them,” an insider exclusively told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;in August, noting that neither is to blame for the breakup. “Their relationship <a href=#>had simply run its course</a> and they decided they just wanted different things.”</p><p class=x_elementToProof>Wonders and Davidson<a href=#> met on the set of the 2022 horror film&nbsp;Bodies, Bodies, Bodies</a>&nbsp;and sparked romance speculation that December when<a href=#> they attended a New York Rangers hockey game</a> together. The pair fueled rumors even further with several more public appearances in the following months, from spending time together in NYC <a href=#>to a day at Universal Studios Hollywood</a> in Los Angeles.</p><p>In January, a second source told Us that Wonders and Davidson <a href=#>had “insane chemistry”</a> on set of Bodies, Bodies, Bodies and that sparks flew even when “the cameras weren’t rolling.”</p><p>They later reunited for Davidson’s show Bupkis. At the April premiere of the Peacock series, Davidson called Wonders “the best,” telling <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight</a>, “She’s the best actress. She’s gonna crush. She’s got a lot of cool stuff going on.”</p><p>Wonders opened up about her and Davidson’s romance one month later during an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Nylon</a> magazine. “We talk about everything, and we are very open with each other about everything, and it feels like what’s happening in our relationship is very sacred,” she shared at the time.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>While another insider told&nbsp;Us in June that the duo were spending their free time together “constantly laughing, joking around, and just having fun,” they hit a bump in the road the following month when Davidson was sentenced to complete community service and attend a traffic school <a href=#>for crashing his car into a Beverly Hills home earlier this summer</a>. (Wonders was in the passenger seat at the time.) That same month, Davidson <a href=#>also checked into rehab</a> for PTSD and borderline personality disorder.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>Davidson has since made his return to stand-up comedy and hosted the season 49 premiere of <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> on October 15. He and <a href=#><strong>Madelyn Cline</strong>,</a> who were first linked in September, made<a href=#> their first public appearance together</a> at the sketch comedy show’s after-party in NYC later that night.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Davidson and the <a href=#>Outer Banks</a> star, 25, have only been together for “several weeks,” a fourth source told Us earlier this month that they are already close.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>“[Madelyn and Pete] had hoped to remain low-key for a while, especially because Madelyn is a really private person,” the insider shared. “But<a href=#> they’ve spent a lot of time together</a> and have built a strong bond&nbsp;in a short period of time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJGosm6%2F1KJksKeembKzv4ycrJ2cnJrAbsHPZquoZZqksm63xJ6psmWRm8GmvoypnK2dXZmut7XDrKanZaOluarAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
