You’ve taught me so much through your generosity and ability to love like no other.”</p><p>The Vampire Diaries alum told <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> in February 2021 that the <a href=#>key to making their relationship work is “communication”</a> during an appearance on SiriusXM’s Radio Andy.</p><p>“Taking time for yourself — for yourselves together [and separately],” he added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After Cohen asked if he was a generous lover, he said “of course,” noting that sex is about “generosity and compassion and giving, you know, it’s all about sharing equal, it’s about sharing.”</p><p>Scroll to take a look back at the pair’s romance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNku6q3yqJkq52VmXqiusNmoJqmXai8rrHRoZilnJWnwG7Dx6Kppa%2BZo7Fuvs6mmKeblWJ%2FcX2Uam1qZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
