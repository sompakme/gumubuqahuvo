What in the world was he thinking?</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, which character was Pacino in the running to play? Let’s head back to the 70s and see which character Al Pacino totally missed out on!</span></p><h2 id=pacino-has-it-in-the-bag>Pacino Has It In The Bag</h2><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> is one of the greatest pieces of cinema history and it still entertains people after being around for decades. In hindsight, it seems like any person would be nuts to pass up on the chance to be in the franchise, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Al Pacino famously did this</a> back in the 70s.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It is important to understand the context of the situation, of course. Al Pacino, during this time, was a massive star in the film industry thanks to appearing in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Godfather</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. That film is considered to be arguably the best film of all time, and it goes without saying that any studio would want to cash in on a star from the film. Turns out, this was the line of thinking of George Lucas and the folks behind </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>In an interview with MTV, Pacino would say, “</span><span style=font-weight:400>I was in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Godfather</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. They didn’t care if I was right or wrong for the role, if I could act or not act.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>These are pretty strong words from Pacino, and it goes to show that one great role is all it takes for someone to be offered the world on a platter. </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was an unknown commodity and no one knew what it would become, so it’s totally understandable that they would see his </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Godfather</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> performance and want to cash in as quickly as possible.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Despite the courting, Pacino would turn down the role, and the role he was up for wound up being as legendary as it gets.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Movies About Las Vegas, Officially Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=al-pacino-scruffy-looking-nerf-herder>Al Pacino: Scruffy Looking Nerf Herder</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Despite being in the running for a major role in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Al Pacino went ahead and passed on it. This wound up being incredibly fortunate for Harrison Ford, who landed the role of Han Solo and turned into a massive movie star in the process.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>For many, it is practically impossible to picture anyone other than Harrison Ford as Han Solo, but the studio was intent on Al Pacino playing the part. Pacino is an amazing actor, but Harrison Ford wound up being too good of a match for the role. Despite having everything in the bag, Pacino moved on.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When speaking with MTV, Pacino would say, </span><span style=font-weight:400>“I remember not understanding (the script) when I read it.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Interestingly, Alec Guinness who famously played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the trilogy was less than thrilled with the script. According to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>ComicBook</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, the talented Guinness wrote a letter to his wife while filming </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and he was quite honest about the script.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He would say, “</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Can't say I'm enjoying the film — new rubbish dialogue reaches me every other day on wages of pink paper — and none of it makes my character clear or even bearable.”</span></i></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thankfully, everything would work out for the unknown space opera in the end, but one has to wonder how Pacino feels about missing out on Han Solo!</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We All Need To Watch These Sports Movies During Lockdown</a></span></p><h2 id=his-feelings-about-missing-out-on-that-han-solo-legacy>His Feelings About Missing Out On That Han Solo Legacy</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Naturally, missing out on a role like Han Solo would be devastating for many actors out there. After all, one big role is all it takes to break into the industry and to secure a future. Al Pacino, despite the massive amount of success that he has had, has certainly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">expressed his feelings</a> about Han Solo and the role of a lifetime.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When talking to MTV, Pacino was able to laugh off missing out on the role, but we have to imagine that it still stings a little bit.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Pacino would say, “</span><span style=font-weight:400>Another missed opportunity!”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Independent</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, other actors were also considered for Han Solo, including Jack Nicholson, Robert de Niro, Burt Reynolds, and James Caan. While they all had plenty of talent between them, Harrison Ford was the right choice for the film.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About The Real Irishman, Jimmy Hoffa</a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>SlashFilm</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Pacino has expressed interest in playing a character in the MCU, and we can only hope that this will happen one day. It’s one opportunity that he won’t pass on.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>While Pacino will always have an incredible legacy in the movie industry, having Han Solo on his resume would have certainly made things a bit sweeter! It also would have made him a whole lot richer.</span></p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A ‘Scarface’ Remake Is Officially In The Works.
