Because "Running Up That Hill" talks about making a deal with God, people often misinterpret it.</p><p>"I was trying to say that, really, a man and a woman can't understand each other because we are a man and a woman. And if we could actually swap each other's roles, if we could actually be in each other's place for a while, I think we'd both be very surprised!" Kate Bush once explained. "And really the only way I could think it could be done was either... you know, I thought a deal with the devil, you know. And I thought, 'well, no, why not a deal with God!' You know, because in a way it's so much more powerful the whole idea of asking God to make a deal with you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The song was originally hugely controversial and even banned in countries where it is now number 1.

Ireland wouldn't play it, and that generally we might get it blocked purely because it had God in the title."</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-kate-bush><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Happened To Kate Bush?</span></h2><p>The once-popular singer now favors a life out of the limelight.
