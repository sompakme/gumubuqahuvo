After Kate Middleton's cancer diagnosis was revealed to the world, he caused controversy by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">slamming the Royal Family for the way they'd handled the announcement</a>.</p><p>"<strong>The palace lied, and the British press happily helped them lie," the CEO said. "The countless 'conspiracy theory' headlines, while knowing a lot of what was being said was true</strong>."</p><p>He then took it a step further, going after the Princess' announcement, saying <strong>"This is really some North Korea/Trumpian type of propaganda."</strong></p><p>As he was quickly faced with backlash, he added "I am sorry to hear Kate has cancer, and I hope she has a full recovery." But he didn't leave it there. Instead, he doubled down on how deceitful he thought the Royal Family had been, saying "It is also clear that all three earlier photos of her were fake, and the palace tried to cover it up."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Not long before these statements, he fueled conspiracy theories about the Princess of Wales's first public sighting after months in hiding</strong>. He wrote: "I've compiled a few older videos of William and Kate walking together, as well as the recent video from Windsor Farm. Take a look and decide for yourself if it’s Kate or not. In my opinion, we still haven’t seen Kate in public."</p><p>"We were told Kate was recovering and would resume her royal duties shortly," he continued. "Yet, in the recent video, she is holding a bag and moving briskly. If she’s capable of such activity, why isn’t she back to fulfilling her royal duties yet?"</p><h2 id=the-relationship-between-prince-harry-and-the-royal-family-is-still-very-strained>The Relationship Between Prince Harry And The Royal Family Is Still Very Strained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kate-middleton-prince-william-prince-harry-meghan-markle.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They say tragedy brings families together, but that doesn't seem to be the case for the Royal Family.
