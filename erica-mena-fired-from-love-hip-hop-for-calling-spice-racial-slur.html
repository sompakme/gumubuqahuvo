While the Jamaican dancehall artist was also called out for bringing up Mena’s son during the confrontation (telling Mena that her eldest son doesn’t like her), Mena caught more slack for her words due to the historical context of comparing Black people, especially those of darker complexions, to monkeys, qualifying it as a racial slur."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Effective immediately, she will not appear in the next season of Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While many observers of the drama support the move, current and past cast members from various Love & Hip Hop franchises have shared their two cents, with some believing the punishment to be too extreme.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In addition to commenting “Sad” on Scott-Young’s message, Stevie J also took to Hollywood Unlocked’s Instagram page and commented “Not Fair” beneath a post sharing the news.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_lil-scrappy data-tag=lil-scrappy>Lil Scrappy</a> also questioned the firing, calling it a “bozo” move on behalf of production because, according to the rapper and reality star, they set up confrontation between cast members for ratings.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Comedian and former Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood guest star <a href=# id=auto-tag_jess-hilarious data-tag=jess-hilarious>Jess Hilarious</a> also spoke out against producers letting Mena go, arguing that Mena’s insult may have been a dig at Spice’s looks, but wasn’t necessarily <a href=#>racist </a>or colorist.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I don’t think Erica Mena was using it as a racial slur. Maybe Spice look like a monkey to her,” Jess argued before adding that if her son were brought up in an argument, “whatever the f**k you look like, I’mma call you that.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She also argued that the timing of her firing feels disingenuous, as the scene was filmed months ago and Mena was only let go once the public saw the fight and cried foul. For the record, it is typical for reality show producers to allow for drama to play out on-screen before addressing it with the public.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While Mena has found support in a few of her fellow L&HH alums, many viewers appear to be in support of her removal from the show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Calling a black person a monkey is racist. A black person calling a black person a monkey is self hate. Out of all the derogatory names the 1st thing to come to your mind is a racist slur.. y’all trippin,” wrote one observer beneath Jess Hilarious’ video, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>with another adding</a>, “Wait so all [Spice] said was her son don’t like her?? That’s not even speaking on the kid, y’all wild af making it seem like she really spoke on her kid(s)….. Now I think Erica even more wrong.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5q%2Fqq%2FAZqSeppFis6q%2BxJ1kpaemmnqptc9mn6ioXai9qq%2FEZqmam5mWuW6%2Fy66pZmliaIF4hJZqbmtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
